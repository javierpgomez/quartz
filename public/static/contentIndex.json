So if this sounds like something you’d like to work toward, participate in a cohort of Ship 30 for 30 to start creating your library of content online and gathering data/analytics on “what’s working.” Alumni are then invited to join The Captain’s Table after they’ve completed at least one cohort of Ship 30 for 30.\nBut until then, we wanted to give you a framework for turning FREE readers into PAID customers.\nAnd the framework goes like this…\nDigital Writing Fast-Track Framework Of The Week: §\nIn order for readers to feel like you are someone worth investing their time, attention, and money into, they need a few questions answered.\nSpecifically, they need 8 questions answered.\nAnd if you can deliver on these 8 questions (in your free content, in the introduction of your book/course, on your landing page, etc.), the likelihood they want to keep investing more in their relationship with you and your content goes up exponentially.\nHere’s the roadmap:\nQuestion #1: Who Are YOU? §\nIf you say, “Hey you,” the reader doesn’t know if you’re talking to them or not.\nAnd if you say, “Hey, mom,” the reader sort of assumes you’re talking to them but they also aren’t quite sure.\nBut if you say, “Hey single-mom struggling to maintain her sanity while raising 2 kids, and dad is at work all day, and you’re stressed about the bills, and you haven’t had a healthy meal in who-knows-how-long,” WOW, that very specific audience knows you’re talking to her and only her.\nAnd that’s the goal.\nThe more specific you can be about who your WHO is, the more likely your target WHO will trust you (because they feel seen, heard, and understood).\nState your WHO.\nQuestion #2: Where is your target reader stuck in Struggle City? §\nImagine your target reader is stuck.\nStuck in Struggle City.\nThey are experiencing 5 huge problems. What are they? Do you know? Can you list them out? How specific can you get?\nAnd what are the causes of these problems? Where do they come from? How does your target reader feel about them? What’s the urgency? How badly do they wish these problems were gone? (If the problems aren’t very urgent or important, then you aren’t talking about the right problems!)\nList the 5 biggest problems your target reader faces today.\nQuestion #3: Who can they blame? §\nThis is sales copywriting 101.\nNever make the customer blame themselves. (When was the last time someone pointed out a problem in your life, where you were the main culprit, and you didn’t get defensive?)\nInstead, give the customer someone/something else to blame.\n\nCan they blame their teachers? Maybe they weren’t given the right information.\nCan they blame their surroundings? Maybe they aren’t in a supportive environment.\nCan they blame their prior purchases? Maybe those promised things but didn’t deliver.\n\nThe point is: the customer needs to feel the urgency to change without feeling bad about themselves and their lack of progress to-date. (This is their “golden bridge” they can retreat on to leave Struggle City for good.)\nGive them something to blame.\nQuestion #4: What are the myths holding them back from making progress? §\nThe reader is ready to change.\nBut they probably have a bunch of “myths” swirling around in their heads helping them rationalize staying stuck in Struggle City.\n\nWhat advice do “most people” give them, and why is it wrong?\nWhat stats do “most people” not know, and how can you educate them?\nWhat beliefs do “most people” internalize, that are doing them a disservice?\n\nThe more you can pull back the curtain and give readers “an insider’s take” on what’s really going on, the more they will see you as the trusted source of truth.\nCall out the myths.\nQuestion #5: What’s the unlikely answer? §\nGiving people obvious solutions to their problems doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence.\nImagine going to Home Depot and saying you don’t know how to build a shed but want to create one, and the guy says, “Well, we’ve got some wood.”\nBoring.\nInstead, you want to give readers (who you want to inspire to turn into customers) the unlikely solution.\nSo instead of saying, “Well, we’ve got wood,” you want to say, “Did you know you can order a ready-to-live shed straight to your door? It comes pre-made for you.”\nAmazing!\nGive the reader the unlikely answer (the thing they weren’t expecting) and 99% of the time, they’ll want more.\nQuestion #6: What are the benefits of this “road less traveled?” §\nYou’ve told them why they’re stuck in Struggle City…\nYou’ve given them someone/something else to blame…\nYou’ve pulled back the curtain and debunked the myths…\nAnd you’ve given them an “unlikely answer,” unlocking the road less traveled…\nNow it’s time to paint the rainbow at the end.\n\nWhat will the reader experience if they take this less-known road?\nWhat are the benefits of going the opposite way as everyone else?\n\nTell them about the pot of gold!\nQuestion #7: What does their life look like “on the other side?” §\nAh, glory.\nIn order for the reader to make the commitment to go on this journey, they need to know it’ll all be worth it.\nSo, don’t hold back. Tell them everything. Tell them what their life will be like. Tell them all the things that will be different (for good and bad). Be honest. Tell them what they can expect to find, who they can expect to meet, and what they can expect to feel. Paint the vision. Give it to them in 4K, HD.\nHelp them visualize the dream.\nQuestion #8: “Are you ready to transform?” §\nFinally, you have to call the reader to adventure.\nDon’t bury the ask.\nDon’t “assume” they’ll take it upon themselves to figure out how to get started.\nTell them, point blank, “Here’s the first step.” Take them by the hand and show them the way. Be their guide, their mentor. Take care of them. Show (no, PROVE!) that you’ve got them, and you won’t let anything bad happen to them along the way.\nAsk them, “Are you ready to transform?”\nYour Weekly Digital Writing Prompt §\nNot sure what to write about today?\nHere’s a prompt to get the creative juices flowing:\nWhat is your favorite memory as a child?\nIf a moment come rushing back into mind, follow it.

Or a strong animal surviving out in the wild.\nWe’ve come to completely associate fitness with doing amazing things and being awesome and strong.\nBut what if I told you that this stupid fish is fit.\nFitness does not mean strong per se.\nReadjusting your definition §\nIf being fit doesn’t mean being strong, then what does it mean?\nBeing fit means that something is suited. When you put on a shirt that fits, this means that it’s not to big and it’s not too small. It’s just right for what you need. It’s the right thing for the right job.\nBeing fit means that something is adapted. It belongs in its environment. It isn’t out of place. It’s not useless and it’s not extra.\nI think of marathon running as a great example for this. There is no instance in your life, when running a marathon will ever be practical. Yes, it can give you a good sense of accomplishment. Yes it can be a great achievement. But I’m 99% percent sure, you’ll never have to run 42km in a day.\nWe don’t have to hunt for our food anymore. We don’t have to run away from lions.\nUnderstanding the demands of your life §\nAsk yourself then: What do I need to be fit for?\nIt’s a big over arching question, that can be vague and hard to answer. I can break it down into a few more questions.\n\nWhat are the physical demands of your work?\n\nAre you lifting heavy things?\nAre you on your feet?\nAre you hunched over all the time? (That’s physical)\n\n\nWhat about the physical demands of your hobbies?\n\nDo you play basketball on weekends?\nDo you like to go hiking or diving?\nDo you like to go on walks?\n\n\nWho benefits from you being fit?\n\nI can play with my pets\nI can play with my kids\nI can help me wife do work around the house\n\n\nWhat kind of activity would you like to do in 20 years? in 30 years?\n\nI’d like to still be walking every day\nI’d like to be climbing mountains when I’m old\nI’d like to be lifting weights as an old man\n\n\n\nYour answers to these questions might give you some idea of what you’re trying to be fit for. And thus, what fitness looks like to you.\nMaking yourself fit to that §\nIf you understand the goal, and you understand the constraints that you have. Then you can start to make some decision that will help your fitness.\nSay from the questions above, I say. My work is sitting at my computer writing all day. But as a hobby I like to do gardening. I mainly want to benefit my wife by being handy around the house, and as I age, I’d like to still be active, walking, maybe running, playing with kids and grandkids.\nAll these give me the constraits to fit my program towards.\n\nI would try to work on the strain from writing\nI would try to be strong enough to lift soil bags\nI would try to be mobile enough to bend down while working in the garden\nI want to have enough cardio health to be able to walk and run\n\nBut if from the questions above, I say: My work is in a restaurant, and I’m always on my feet. I love trianing for marathons, and I want to help other people run too. As I age, I’d still like to be running long distances.\nThen for me, what it means to be fit is:\n\nI work on my knees and other running muslces\nI think about the long term health of my running\n\nNo one fitness program is good for everyone.\nIn none of the above examples does being fit entail lifting 100s of pouds in bench presses. (That may be fit for some people, but not for everyone). So you can be living a very simple, modest exercise life, and still be very fit!\nFitness is just that. How suited is your workout to your lifestlye.\nRedefining fitness for yourself §\nThis kind of fitness changes over time too.\nAs you grow,\nAnd your life changes.\nWhat it means to be fit changes with it also.\nThis is just the natural progressionof things."},"Notes/A-List-of-My-Favorite-Things":{"title":"A List of My Favorite Things","links":["Frank-Ambrosio","Notes/Hollow-Knight-(story)"],"tags":[],"content":"A List of My Favorite Things §\n\n\nOnline Dante Course\n\nIt actually works like an online illuminated manuscript.\nWhich is such an amazing concept \nby: [Frank Ambrosio]\n\n\n\nHollow Knight (story)\n\nThis game is just brilliant to me\nThe storytelling.

The promise had been a significant part of the political campaign.\nWhat makes this story particularly noteworthy is the work of independent journalist Michael, who dedicated himself to uncovering the truth. Michael’s investigative efforts brought him into contact with many farmers, allowing him to gather firsthand accounts and insights.\nIn an era where journalism is undergoing transformation, independent journalists like Michael continue to be vital contributors to society. They bring transparency, accountability, and truth to the forefront of public discourse. Michael’s dedication to reporting on issues that matter to the Filipino people serves as a reminder of the power of independent journalism.\nThis note not only recognizes the importance of Michael’s work but also underscores the value of independent journalism in ensuring that promises made by politicians are scrutinized and held to account.

The narrative that we are evolutionarily wired to conserve energy, to be ‘naturally lazy,’ often clashes with the reality I observe and live.\nConsidering the “Active Grandparent Hypothesis,” I find a compelling evolutionary argument: our ancestors weren’t mere survivors by chance but thrived due to their active engagement with life. It asserts that the tapestry of our genetic legacy may be woven with threads favoring activity, especially as we age, enhancing health and the ability to nurture the young.\nThis hypothesis resonates, suggesting an intrinsic reward system for sustained activity throughout life. It challenges the modern sedentary norms and rekindles the age-old wisdom that movement is life.

He’s a coach who is obsessed with the words we use when teaching movement.\nHis main idea is that the words that we use matter. It has a measurable effect on our performance. This is most useful for coaches. But even if you’re a regular person trying to move better, there are a few takeaways to help you here.\nHere are some quick principles from my first jump in.\n\n1. Use an external cue §\nInstead of saying “lift your arms more” (internal cue), try saying instead “push towards the ceiling.” (external cue) The reason this works is that with an internal cue you zone in on one body part, and the body as a whole coordinates less. But with an external cue, your whole body focuses on that goal, and the body coordinates better.\n2. Use metaphors and images §\nApart from external cues, using images and metaphors also helps the body coordinate. Try using different images when you’re doing movements.\n\n“Take of like a plane” when you’re sprinting\n“Bounce like a gazelle” when jumping\n“Sit back into a chair” when doing a squat\n\nHear Nick Winkelman talk about it here\n3. Get into Trial and Error §\nBecause we’re using metaphors and images, there’s a bit of trial and error involved. We have different images in our head. Some metaphors might work better for you than others. It becomes more of an art than a science at this point. Trying different things and experimenting is the name of the game.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/Art-of-Link-Curation":{"title":"Art of Link Curation","links":["Notes/You-are-what-you-eat","Notes/Dimensions-of-Reality"],"tags":[],"content":"up:: You are what you eat\nArt of Link Curation §\nLinks matter.\nSharing link-based knowledge online has revealed new responsibilities—and opportunities.\nDon’t overwhelm your reader with lazy linking to every dang thing.

Because over time, the backlinks will overpopulate like weeds, covering up the more valuable connections by their sheer numbers.\nIt’s the same thing that happened to many people in Evernote who saved too many articles. It buried the personally meaningful links under a pile of mostly worthless links. Over time, you end up scrolling and wasting more and more time hunting for meaningful links amidst all the noise of all the false-positives.

MOC\ntags::#flow\nAttention §\nAttention is what the mind is focused on—and what it has been focused on over the recent past (the past 72 hours is simple way to look at it). Everything that enters the mind in the past 72 hours affects the next hour of thought. That’s what it’s so important to Guard and Guide Your Mind wisely.\nGuard what enters your mind, and what stays in the mind. Reduce distractions. Reduce attentional switching.\nSubsets of Attention §\n\nFocus — The ability to maintain focus is of crucial importance in any aspect of modern living. Without focus, life drifts from stimuli to stimuli, with very little consistent Direction (re Flow).\nResidual Attention — Your attention isn’t just about what you are thinking about right now; it’s more so composed of everything that’s entered your mind over past 72 hours.\n\nSimilar Keywords: Attentional Residue, Echo, Resonating, Ripples, Shadows, Reflections, Glimmers, Whispers, Deja Vu, Attention Robbers, Attentional Switching, Distraction Radiation, Distraction Amnesia, Continuity of Thought\n\n\n\nMain Factors Governing Attention §\n\nIntensity and Frequency of Distractions\n\nSurroundings and Environment\n\n\nQuality of Diet\n\nCauses of Poor Attention §\n\nDistractions — Distractions come in many forms and factors. Below is a list of major sources of distraction to safeguard against:\nPoor Diet (not available in the LYT Kit) — Sugar makes people act impulsively; they become more susceptible to distractions. Grains can cause brain fog to lowers mood and Enthusiasm. Both dramatically raise blood sugar levels causing the secretion of Insulin. The resulting fall of blood glucose levels causes hunger, irritability, and energy crashes.\nAverage Diet — Even an average diet can still have several micro-nutrient deficiencies that can be the cause of headaches, lower Energy (re Flow) levels, mood swings, a lack of enthusiasm.\nLack of Enthusiasm (re Flow)\nLack of Direction (re Flow)\n\nSolutions to Poor Attention §\n\nReducing Distractions in Intensity and Frequency\nHaving a Good Diet\n"},"Notes/Attention-For-Simone-Weil":{"title":"Attention For Simone Weil","links":["Maps/Philosophy-MOC","Notes/Learning-to-Pay-Attention","tags/on/simone-weil","tags/on/attention","tags/on/presence","Notes/Social-Media-Hijacks-Attention"],"tags":["on/simone-weil","on/attention","on/presence"],"content":"up:: Philosophy MOC\nX:: Learning to Pay Attention\ntags::#on/simone-weil#on/attention#on/presence\nnovelty::\nLink to Reference §\nurl: How I’m trying to see everything with fresh eyes again\nKey Ideas §\nFor Simone Weil, when something is deserving of attention, it does not mean that I direct my present energy and focus to figuring out what I should look at and focus on it\nAttention is more of a preparation.

The key to sustainable progress lies in adopting a “builder mindset.” This mindset is not just about constructing something new but also about understanding the foundational ‘why’ behind each action.\nTo maintain this balance, especially for those who naturally lean towards a more relaxed approach, it’s crucial to continually interrogate your ‘why.’ Start with the immediate reason and keep asking “why do I care about that?” until you reach the core motivation. This exercise serves as a compass, ensuring that you’re aligned with your deepest values and objectives, thereby enabling you to operate optimally in “builder mode.”\nThis is not just a mental exercise but a tool for recalibration. It helps you to avoid complacency and ensures that you’re not just building for the sake of building, but for a purpose that deeply resonates with you.\n\nRead more at: How Builders Think\nGo one level up : Entrepreneurship MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Embracing the Art of “Showing Up” in the World of Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/Balanga-Bus-Schedule":{"title":"Balanga Bus Schedule","links":["Extras/Images/Balanga-Bus-Schedule.heic"],"tags":[],"content":"Balanga Bus Schedule.heic"},"Notes/Bamboo-spends-most-of-its-life-underground-undern":{"title":"Bamboo spends most of its life underground undern","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Bamboo spends most of its life underground undern"},"Notes/Barcelona-Based-People":{"title":"Barcelona Based People","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://twitter.com/bobzyeruncle\nhttps://twitter.com/Mehdiyac\nhttps://twitter.com/sangeet_kar"},"Notes/Barney-Meekin":{"title":"Barney Meekin","links":["2022-06-16"],"tags":[],"content":"2022-06-16 Helpful links for copywriters §\nHis newsletter was helpful\n\nWebsite copy editor (only found out about this today — but it’s pretty sweet so added it to the list)\n​https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/free-website-editing-tool/​\nWord association dictionary\n​https://relatedwords.org/​\nCliché finder\n​https://www.clichefinder.net/​\nAI paraphraser\n​https://www.wordtune.com/ &amp; https://quillbot.com/​\nEmail subject line preview\n​https://www.emailtooltester.com/en/email-subject-lines-tester/​\nIdiom dictionary\n​https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/​\nRhyme dictionary\n​http://www.b-rhymes.com/\n"},"Notes/Barney's-Sales-Pitch":{"title":"Barney's Sales Pitch","links":[],"tags":["-on/swipe-file-"],"content":"Hello\nApplying for this job is a long shot\nTruth is\nI’m a new copywriter.

Below is a list of benefits derived from having your notes equipped with fluid frameworks like a Home note and Maps of Content.\n\nBenefits §\nProvides Reliability §\nHaving a Home note and MOCs act as reliable home bases to re-ground your thoughts whenever they begin to waver. Like a parent to a five-year old, linked frameworks like MOCs are a consistent and comforting safety net.\nDisregard this at your own peril.  1\nProvides Flexibility §\n\nFluid Frameworks like the Home note and Maps of Content don’t limit access; they curate it.\n\nThey are like a top-notch concierge that directs you to where you want to be.\nSee Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea.\nLaunches the Brain §\nThe LYT framework is filled with your personalized reminders of important categories of knowledge and their key terms. It helps kickstart the brain—reducing the activation energy needed to start thinking and connecting ideas.\nEnhances Note Retrieval §\nNote retrieval becomes easier when you’re staring at many possible access points: your main categories, contexts, maps, and tags. 2 Notes become tethered like Wolverine:\n\nAlleviates Overwhelm §\nMOCs Overview (MOCs) are your key to adding structure to the chaos, especially as your digital library grows. The ability to sense the tickle of anxiety and build an MOC is oftentimes the difference between a finished project and an abandoned one.\nEncourages Relational, Positional Thinking §\nMaking a Map of Content forces a rich, engaging relational battle between notes. Notes jockey for position in your brain, and each placement by you embeds them with additional meaning.\nAids in Linking with Pre-built Contexts §\nYour 10 or so main maps provide a pre-built latticework upon which to hang your new notes. It’s a personalized classification system for your digital knowledge. Tethering to these hub-like maps vastly enhance long-term storage and retrieval.\nFuture-Proofs for your Future Self §\nThere are months that go by where I don’t open my digital library. Before adopting plain text and adding structure, I would get anxiety when I would finally re-open it. Now, however, I don’t get that anxiety because I have my trusty Home note, Maps of Content and other fluid ways of categorizing and retrieving info. In no time, I’m back up to speed and off to the races.\nImproves Memory §\nTransclude of block dbdd21\nBecause of the well-traveled structural pathways that the Home note and Maps of Content encourage, my recall has improved. This makes sense because of three important factors that working with “linked frameworks” encourages:\n\nReps - I’m constantly returning to a home view and then re-launching into new directions in my digital library.\nConceptual Thinking - Making MOCs forces you to really consider the unique qualities of the thought you’re holding and how it relates to other thoughts. This conceptual [[thinking through linking]] strengthens neural connections—making Cobwebs into Cables.\nSpatial Context - Your main MOCs are numbered and always at the top of the sidebar (when sorted A to Z). This way, they act as a spatial map. We remember things much better when we have a spatial constellation of related things.\n\nIncreases Satisfaction §\nWe spend too much time with our notes not to experience joy with them. LYT structures allow you to fly around your digital library with the deftness of a surgeon and the joy of a chimpanzee swinging from branch to branch.\n%%\n\nDid you know this article is LIVE online right now, but no one online can see these hidden “comments” except us :)\nWow, this note uses at least 18 different formatting methods:\ninternal links, embeds, headers, dividers, emphasis with bolds, italics, bold+italics, lists, images, piped links, external links, blockquotes, inline code, tables, strikethroughs, highlights, footnotes, and comments. \n\nThe first three benefits as a table §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefitDescriptionProvides ReliabilityReliable places to ground thoughtsProvides FlexibilityFluid frameworks don’t limit, they curateLaunches the BrainJump Kickstarts your brain\n%%\n\nNext §\nThe benefits are exhaustive—and we haven’t even talked about Idea Emergence!\nBut you may still be asking: Is LYT For Me?\nFootnotes §\n\n\nDo not underestimate the peace of mind that comes from a reliable, dependable digital library. Being unable to access something you know you have is basically a form of “Digital Dementia”. ↩\n\n\nI like to make my digital library super robust. That means I have several avenues built-in to re-discover a note. I find this process of “connecting to conceptual cousins” further cements each idea into my memory.

A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won 11 NBA championships during his 13-year career.[2] Russell and Henri Richard of the National Hockey League are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.[3] Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He led the San Francisco Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956,[4] and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[5]\nDespite his limitations on offense, as Russell averaged 15.1 points per game, his rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era.[6][7][8][9] Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) arm span,[10][11] his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics’ dominance during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities, and he led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[12] and remains second all time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.[13]\nRussell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in the NBA and the first to win a championship.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15]\nRussell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[5] one of only four players to receive all three honors, and selected into the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP Award in his honor.[16] In 2021, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time for his coaching career.[17] Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell’s jersey number 6 league-wide, becoming the only player in NBA history to receive the honor.[18]"},"Notes/Biodynamic-Farming-in-the-Philippinies":{"title":"Biodynamic Farming in the Philippinies","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/soil","tags/composting"],"tags":["idea-note","soil","composting"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#soil#composting\nurl: https://www.downtoearth.ph/biodynamic-composting/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nWe get ours from Greg Kitma of PhilBio\nSee also §"},"Notes/Bitcoin-perhaps-is-more-like-jewelery-that-currency":{"title":"Bitcoin perhaps is more like jewelery that currency","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Bitcoin perhaps is more like jewelery that currency"},"Notes/Black-Soldier-Fly-Resources":{"title":"Black Soldier Fly Resources","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://www.evoconsys.com/blog/house-fly-inhibition-by-black-soldier-fly-how-do-they-do-it\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00987968\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Grow-Black-Soldier-Flies\nhttps://kimmyfarm.com/en/black-soldier-flies-calcium-worm-breeding-techniques\nhttps://www.thecritterdepot.com/blogs/news/how-to-breen-black-soldier-fly-larvae"},"Notes/Blind-guy-Travels-podcast-(story)":{"title":"Blind guy Travels podcast (story)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Blind guy travels (podcast) §\nCan’t make facial expressions\nBecause he can’t copy\nWhich is inate to us\nThis is why blind people have a bit of that blank expression.\nIt’s something that I took for granted\nBecause you don’t even think about how you copy facial expressions"},"Notes/Blockchain-and-search-engines":{"title":"Blockchain and search engines","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1406400770581303297\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Blockchains-and-Transparency":{"title":"Blockchains and Transparency","links":["Maps/Web3-MOC","Notes/The-trap-of-giving-up-religion-for-science","Notes/Science-can-be-just-as-cherry-picky-as-religion"],"tags":[],"content":"up:: Web3 MOC\nX:: The trap of giving up religion for science\ntags:: web3\nnovelty::\nLink to Reference §\nurl: Interview: Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum\nKey Ideas §\nLike what democracies aspire to be, a blockchain is highly open and transparent, and anyone can verify that the rules are being followed.

When we lock ourselves into a static idea of who we are, we do a disservice to our potential for transformation.\nYou Are a Verb, Not a Noun\nOften, it’s not that we can’t change, but that our perceptions of ourselves are mired in the past. Remember, you are not a fixed entity. You’re more like a verb, in a constant state of becoming.\nNavigating Two Worlds: Stability and Transformation\nIt’s true, routine and patterns serve a purpose. They provide a comfort zone, a place of predictable outcomes. But that’s a double-edged sword. While they keep us safe, they also confine us. Balancing the need for stability with the potential for growth is crucial, and it’s a challenge I often grapple with in my approach to health and self-improvement.\nExpanding Horizons Through Self-Questioning\nThe trick lies in constantly asking oneself questions aimed at shaking up the status quo.

On one hand, the tangible resilience of paper offers longevity that modern digital mediums struggle to match. On the other, the searchability and compactness of digital storage are unmatched in the physical realm.\nConsidering a scenario where the entirety of web content is relegated to paper, confined within the vastness of several hangars, one can’t help but ponder the practicality of such a method. The thought alone underscores the need for a hybrid solution – one that combines the durability of paper with the expedient access of digital devices.\nIt’s interesting to speculate on how the robustness of paper, which has proven its lasting nature through centuries, could be married to the swift retrievability inherent in digital formats. This has led me to appreciate the impermanence embedded in our current storage modalities, digital included. True, digital data does not face the decay of organic matter, but it is far from immune to the obsolescence of technology and the deterioration of media.\nIn my quest for efficient data storage, I am reminded that innovation must respect the balance between enduring substance and agile availability. I envision a future where data can stand the test of time without sacrificing the convenience of query. This is a call to not only develop storage media that can last for eons but also to devise systems that allow for the rapid extraction of knowledge. As I grapple with these concepts, I realize that the journey toward perfecting data preservation is as much about embracing the strengths of our past as it is about engineering the breakthroughs of our future.\n\nRead more at: Very Long-Term Backup - The Rosetta Project\nYou may also be interested in: The Duality of Information Overload in the Age of Abundance"},"Notes/Build-From-Broken":{"title":"Build From Broken","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://saltwrap.com/built-from-broken/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Build-a-Geodesic-Dome":{"title":"Build a Geodesic Dome","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Build a Geodesic Dome Shape §\nSource §\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V96rdUOpsKA\n\nKey Ideas §\n\nIt’s an interesting shape and would be fun to try\n"},"Notes/Build-a-System":{"title":"Build a System","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/editing","tags/witing","tags/on/willpower","tags/habits","Your-system-will-be-imperfect--and-that's-okay"],"tags":["permanent-note","editing","witing","on/willpower","habits"],"content":"topic: 202112081100- Build a System\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#editing#witing#on/willpower#habits\nlinks: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1491908939038216195 §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nSomehow, Stephen King can write a book a year.\nHe makes it look so effortless.

It’s becomes a problem when it goes overboard.\nThe same thing with our inner saboteur voices.\nWhen it comes to your body and injuries- it’s that voice that tries everything to keep you from your recovery.\nThat voice might tell you that your body is weak, and not recovered. It might tell you that you’re going to injure yourself again if you get back into exercise and activity.\nSometimes that voice will tell you that you were stupid to get yourself injured in the first place! (My voice does this all the time) It tells me that I was being dumb and always putting myself in danger. I would be better off if I didn’t do anything instead.\nYour voice might say that it’s not important to you right now, and that you can put it off for next time. There are all sorts of excuses that your saboteur can use to keep you from taking action and getting out of an injured mindset.\nSo next time you hear your inner saboteur speaking, remember that it’s the voice of fear. It has a role, but it cannot control your whole life.\n–\nWhat should you do instead?\nIn the same way you have an inner saboteur that sabotages you, you also have an inner sage.\nYou can call it many things- your true self, your best self, even your inner coach.\nYour sage is the part of that knows what you need to do. It comes from a place of calm, trust and wisdom. The challenge is that we are out of practice when it comes to listening to that sage wisdom.\nBecause of the many things in our environment or society.\nSo if you’re having trouble with your injury. And it keeps bringing up anxiety, perfectionism, and other negative thought patterns. You can practice listening to your inner sage.\nInstead of letting your saboteurs win, start learning to trust your inner sage. \n–\nRemember, when it comes to your recovery the mind is a powerful tool that can work for or against you.\nYou might say, isn’t this a self fulfilling prophecy? If I’m optimistic and positive, then of course things will improve.\nbut if I’m negative and stuck in saboteurs thinking, then I’ll go in that direction also.\nThe answer is yes and no. It is a self fulfilling prophecy in the sense that what we focus on develops. While what we ignore gets weaker.\nMy favorite image to think about this is a trail in the woods. I like to go on on hikes, and sometimes I find myself in a place where the trail is bad and difficult. The problem is that I don’t have a better path to take- so I stick to the bad path. \nIt’s a lot of hard work to forge a new and better path when I’m on a hike. But if I have a guide, we can plan out a good route together. Plus, once I get on a good path once- the next time, I’ll have an easier time finding it.\nOver time, if I follow the good path enough- I start to remember how to get there. The trail becomes easier to spot. My hike becomes a lot easier.\nLetting ourselves get taken over by negative saboteur thinking gets us stuck in that bad path. For injuries, it can be believing that things will never get better. Or that our bodies will never be the same again.\nIf we focus on negativity, we will trap ourselves in that negative thinking pattern.\nBut, it is also true that we have the power to choose our thoughts and emotions. By choosing to listen to our wise sage, we can start to forge a new and better path to recovery. It is challenging for sure, especially in the beginning. But over time it gets easier and easier.\n–\nFor now, it is good to explore- what are some of the negative ideas I have surrounding my body and my injury?\nDon’t worry about getting rid of those thoughts right now. Like many important things, it takes time and practice.\nBut being aware of the negative saboteur thoughts that keep coming to you is a great first step. By having those in mind, and even writing them down- you’ll setting yourself up for choosing a better path in the future.\n**"},"Notes/Building-your-own-health-system":{"title":"Building your own health system","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1485206537455149059 §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nAt the end of the day, you can’t just copy-paste someone else’s health system and expect it to work for you.

Today we have even discovered planets orbiting other stars.\nCosmos Quotes §\nThe surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we’ve learned most of what we know.

This is because learning and maintaining habits happens in the basal ganglia, a part of your brain that can function normally even if the rest of your brain is damaged.\nUnfortunately, this resilience means that even if you kick a bad habit, like smoking, you will always be at risk of relapsing.\nHabits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort and therefore endure. They are Natural Selection in action. See: Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage.\nHabits stick because they create craving.\n\ngolden rule of changing any habit: don’t resist craving, redirect it\n\ndo this by keeping the cue and the reward and just replacing the routine.\n\n\n\nWhat Keystone Habits are really about, and probably why I’ve always struggled with the term, 1 is because behavioral change is really driven by small wins—ie early victories that are relatively easy to reach. Therefore it’s “small wins” and not “keystone habits” that help you viscerally believe that change is possible.\nWhat Duhigg—and over 500 research articles who referenced Baumeister’s work—got wrong: “Willpower is the most important keystone habit.” No, it’s not. This finding, which is false, directed my attentions for the next several years, only to realize that willpower is way, way overrated and the studies were rotten (looking at you Baumeister!).\nFollowing habits is not only a key part of our lives but also a key part of organizations and companies. All habits comprise a cue-routine-reward loop, and the easiest way to change this is to substitute the routine for something else while keeping the cue and reward the same. Achieving lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such as willpower.\nFootnotes §\n\n\nToo simple perhaps, because in making the process super sticky with only 3 steps, he left out an important fourth step between Cue and Routine: Craving. James Clear picked up on this too and made it explicit in How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits ↩ ↩2\n\n\n"},"Notes/Chaotic-systems":{"title":"Chaotic systems","links":["Notes/wicked-problem"],"tags":[],"content":"Chaotic systems and Adaptability §\nMost things are chaotic systems\naka\nwicked problem\nTherefore one must be adaptible"},"Notes/Charles-dickens-wrote-in-episodes-and-cliffhangers":{"title":"Charles dickens wrote in episodes and cliffhangers","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSo aparently Charles Dickens wrote serial style\nThey were basically atomic essays\nhaha\nSee also §"},"Notes/Charlie-Brown's-America":{"title":"Charlie Brown's America","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Charlie Brown’s America §"},"Notes/Charting-out-habit-cycles-in-my-life-circa-2013":{"title":"Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","tags/log/journal"],"tags":["habit","log/journal"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit#log/journal\nCharting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013 §\nThe following is an example of me considering the habitual cues in my life that I wanted to control in March of 2013.\nMORNING §\nMini Workout §\n\nCues: Not thinking, just getting out of bed and going to the bathroom.\nRoutine: Proprioception Balance: 30 secs both sides\n\nJoint Warm-up: Ankles, knees, hips, elbows, shoulders, neck [Alt: Walk 5-10 min]\n25 Bird Dog/Fire Hydrants / 25 Retraction Pushups / 25 Abs: Plank Spiders\n25 Bodyweight Squats/Lunges / Headstand 1 min\nVisualize a great day with good standing posture\n\n\nReward: Early morning feeling of accomplishment, self-control, and endorphins.\n\nBreakfast §\n\nCues: Finishing good standing posture visualization\nRoutine: Prepare Greek Yogurt, Almonds, Cinnamon / Have vitamins, stimulant\nReward: Satiation of hunger.

This notion resonates with the idea that “homo cinematicus is homo ludens,” revealing the profound impact of cinema on our lives.\nDirectorial styles can be likened to different liturgies, each offering a distinct lens through which we perceive truth. While this concept applies to cinema as a whole, some auteurs embody it with exceptional clarity. Wes Anderson, for instance, unmistakably captures our senses, drawing us into his vivid and meticulously crafted worlds. His films, in a sense, become rites of passage, inviting us to engage more deeply.\nBut Wes Anderson is not alone in this endeavor. Other directors, like Paul Schrader, bring their unique perspectives to the cinematic ritual. Schrader’s exploration of reality through his lens adds yet another layer to the tapestry of cinematic liturgy. It’s through these directors and their distinctive visions that we can appreciate the full spectrum of human experience in the world of cinema.\n\nRead more at: Wes Anderson’s Chafings Against the Immanent Frame: An Addendum | Church Life Journal | University of Notre Dame\nGo one level up : Spirituality MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Disappearing Art Of Maintenance"},"Notes/Circular-saw-for-steel":{"title":"Circular saw for steel","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Circular saw for steel §\nRemember, you can’t use your woodworking mitre saw for steel!\nVincenzo Karpintero talks about this.\nYou can’t just use the same circular saw.\nI think when the time comes, I’ll just ask for help from Vincenzo!"},"Notes/Classic-psychedelics-in-the-treatment-of-substance-use-disorder-Potential-synergies-with-twelve-step-programs":{"title":"Classic psychedelics in the treatment of substance use disorder Potential synergies with twelve-step programs","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353485146_Classic_psychedelics_in_the_treatment_of_substance_use_disorder_Potential_synergies_with_twelve-step_programs\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Coaches-Need-Coaches":{"title":"Coaches Need Coaches","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coaches need coaches\nhttps://twitter.com/JLPGomez/status/1438290329694785537"},"Notes/Coaching-Health-is-a-positive-sum-game":{"title":"Coaching Health is a positive sum game","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/coaching","tags/health","tags/cooperation","Notes/Therapeutic-Alliance","Notes/Teaching-benefits-the-teacher-the-most"],"tags":["permanent-note","coaching","health","cooperation"],"content":"topic: 202203181056 - Coaching Health is a positive sum game\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#coaching#health#cooperation\nurl: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1490102934239350784 §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nDon’t think of health and coaching as a one-way street\nThe best health and coaching relationships are where both sides cooperate in order to get the results.\nIt’s not just the coach telling you what to do all the time.

With the promise of “very positive results,” it’s tempting to herald CFT as the ultimate answer. However, like all scientific studies, its scope and applicability come with nuances—strengths and weaknesses—that should be evaluated alongside existing literature.\nAn Objective Evaluation §\nEngaging experts like Greg in dissecting the study offers a balanced perspective. It gives us the analytical tools to understand where CFT shines and where it falls short. For example, does the study address the long-term sustainability of CFT, or is it focused merely on short-term relief?\nPersonal Relevance §\nBeing someone who struggles with chronic pain, I find this study particularly intriguing. CFT resonates with me because it isn’t just about masking symptoms; it offers a cognitive approach that could help me understand the roots of my pain. It provides a multi-faceted strategy which, when used judiciously, could potentially offer long-term benefits for managing chronic conditions like mine.\nContext Matters §\nThe value of this study is also contextual. How does CFT stack up against other treatment modalities in the broader spectrum of pain management solutions? Does it offer advantages over pharmacological approaches, or does it work best when integrated with other therapies?\nThe Broader Lens §\nLastly, it’s essential to interpret the study’s findings in light of the broader literature on chronic pain management. The strengths and weaknesses illuminated by experts can help tailor CFT to individual needs, thereby increasing its efficacy and potential for real-world application.\n\nRead more at: URL\nYou may also be interested in: Cognitive Functional Therapy"},"Notes/Cognitive-Functional-Therapy":{"title":"Cognitive Functional Therapy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Cohabitation-is-a-luxury-belief":{"title":"Cohabitation is a luxury belief","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/marriage","tags/cohabitation","tags/luxury-belief","Notes/Luxury-Beliefs"],"tags":["idea-note","marriage","cohabitation","luxury-belief"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#marriage#cohabitation#luxury-belief\nurl: https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/no-one-expects-young-men-to-do-anything?s=r\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nRob Henderson’s stuff\nI like him because he’s a smart conservative\nKey Idea §\nThe idea that cohabiting partnerships are good is a luxury belief\nBecause if you you money, the problems that come with a cohabiting partnership not working out are less detrimental\nBut when people without money try to do this it doesn’t really work out as well for them\nSee also §\nLuxury Beliefs"},"Notes/CohereDAO-and-Inequality-and-Social-Justice":{"title":"CohereDAO and Inequality and Social Justice","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/on/coheredao","tags/consciousness","tags/local-community","tags/regenerative"],"tags":["idea-note","on/coheredao","consciousness","local-community","regenerative"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#on/coheredao#consciousness#local-community#regenerative\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/626a42d01239922546884a41\nhttps://www.airr.io/quote/626a4354123992254688bc44\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nI want to be conscious of this.

However, there’s an intriguing counterargument: anchoring your journey around 2-3 core topics that align with your ultimate vision. This approach is much more than a mere compromise between generalization and specialization; it’s about honing multiple skills or interests that serve a greater purpose.\nChoosing 2-3 core topics doesn’t confine you; it liberates you. It allows you to diversify your skill set and enrich your journey towards your end goal. Take for instance, someone whose ultimate aim is financial freedom. They could delve into e-commerce, study budgeting strategies, or even explore a digital nomad lifestyle with various side hustles. The choices aren’t mutually exclusive; they’re different paths leading to the same summit.\nThis got me questioning my own approach. Do I niche down to a single path, or embrace multiple avenues that align with my overall vision? Given my inclination for varied interests, I see merit in the latter. It’s like assembling a tool kit; why limit myself to a hammer when I could use a wrench and a screwdriver too?\nUnderstanding your skills and interests as avenues to your ultimate vision, rather than impediments, could be a game-changing perspective. We’re often so focused on the means that we lose sight of the end, but integrating multiple skills or interests can make the journey not just feasible but also far more enriching.\n\nRead more at: “Niche Down” Is Terrible Advice (For Smart People) - Dan Koe\nYou may also be interested in: Path dependence"},"Notes/Create-don't-idolize-books":{"title":"Create don't idolize books","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/627b10741239922546f7e2db\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nIdealizing ideas\ninstead of learning to create yourself\nThat you should write something for yourself and create ideas\nSee also §"},"Notes/Create-your-own-weekend":{"title":"Create your own weekend","links":[],"tags":["-rest-recovery-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThere always needs to be a day of rest\nSee also §"},"Notes/Creating-something-to-make-enough-money-to-survive":{"title":"Creating something to make enough money to survive","links":["Notes/A-vision-of-the-creator-economy-that-works"],"tags":["-on/creator-creator-economy-business--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nnewyorker.com\nThe Rise of the Internet’s Creative Middle Class\nurl: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rise-of-the-internets-creative-middle-class\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nIf your creative work exists in the long tail, generating a small but consistent number of sales, then it’s probably sufficiently good to support a small but serious (View Highlight)\nSee also §\nA vision of the creator economy that works"},"Notes/Creative-Fidelity-(concept)":{"title":"Creative Fidelity (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Creative Fidelity (concept) §\nContext §\nThis is a concept in philosophy\nIt’s very rich\nbut quite abstract\nAnalogy or story §\nI use the idea of marriage here\nYou have to be flexible and not unchanging\nYou will have 3 marriages in your lifetime\nPossilbe to the same person\nApplications §\nMany times we fail because we are too rigid\nHaving flexibiliy lets you make changes when you have to"},"Notes/Creative-Rabbit-Holes":{"title":"Creative Rabbit Holes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Creative Rabbit Holes §\nSource: §\n\nhttps://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-01300-002\n\nKey Idea §\n\nSpecific Curiosity and Idea Linking\nIt’s about linking different ideas\nAnd then using that as inspiration\n"},"Notes/Creative-problem-problem-solving-is-like-improv":{"title":"Creative problem problem solving is like improv","links":["Notes/Gunpei-Yokoi-and-Lateral-Thinking-with-Withered-Technology","Notes/Creative-problem-solving-means-suspending-judgement"],"tags":["-on/creativity-improv-brainstorming--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nHannah England\nCreative Problem Solving: from complex challenge to innovative solution\nurl: https://nesslabs.com/creative-problem-solving\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nTangential to the second principle, the third principle for creative problem solving is to defer judgement.\nCreative Problem Solving requires you to say “yes, and” rather than “no, but” in order to encourage generative discussions.\nImprov like\nSee also §\nGunpei Yokoi and Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology\nCreative problem solving means suspending judgement"},"Notes/Creative-problem-solving-means-suspending-judgement":{"title":" Creative problem solving means suspending judgement ","links":["Notes/Try-Googling-the-Opposite","Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/How-Play-Trains-you-up-for-Adult-Skills"],"tags":["-creativity-","-ideas-","-brainstroming-"],"content":"When you’re brainstorming, it’s better to bring EVERY idea to the table, including the craziest and wildest ideas.\nSurprisingly, even with a little modification, those outrageous ideas may later become the most plausible solutions.\nBut to do this, you have to silence your inner judge, or inner critic.

Yet, there’s an undercurrent that goes beyond mere effort and tactics: the role of luck and the resulting obligation for generosity.\nI’ve observed that luck doesn’t just create a pedestal for the individual; it weaves a safety net through the connections nurtured by kindness. It’s a form of an invisible currency that cements your standing within your community—a community that stands with you through the ebbs and flows of fortune.\nIt’s my belief that embracing benevolence, especially when lady luck smiles upon us, plants seeds of goodwill. These seeds grow into a garden of support, where the fruits are not just for one to savor but for the whole community to feast upon. This exchange of goodwill is a stabilizer in the volatile journey of life and career, ensuring that when the unpredictable tides of challenge wash over, you’re not standing alone.\nMy philosophy has always aligned with the notion that one’s network is their net worth. In being kind, we’re investing in a bank of reciprocity that yields dividends of loyalty and mutual aid. It’s a testament to the fact that being nice isn’t just a moral choice; it’s a strategic one.\nThrough this lens, I view my community not as a secondary benefit to success but as a foundational pillar. Money comes and goes, but the wealth found in reliable relationships and a supportive community is priceless. This wealth fosters a sustainable, enduring success—one not solely based on the fickleness of luck but on the solid ground of mutual respect and assistance.\nReflections on Generosity and Success\nWhen I consider my own path, I am reminded that the stability and growth of my endeavors are as much a product of communal strength as they are of personal effort. In this way, we cultivate a symbiotic success, where our triumphs are communal, and our setbacks are softened by the cushion of collective support.\n\nRead more at: The Luckier You Are The Nicer You Should Be · Collab Fund\nYou may also be interested in: Paying it Forward- Quite literally"},"Notes/Cultivating-Productive-Mindfulness-and-Efficiency":{"title":"Cultivating Productive Mindfulness and Efficiency","links":["Notes/Have-Some-Go-to-Habits"],"tags":["productivity","mvp","minimum-viable-product","critical-thinking","process-optimization"],"content":"The concept of time-blocking has always intrigued me, and setting aside focused intervals for thought and action crystallizes this fascination. To surface deep thoughts, a one-hour timer aligns with the natural rhythm of my concentration. Within this span, a Google Doc becomes a canvas for brainstorming, unfettered by the usual constraints of constant connectivity.\nEqually compelling is the notion of the ‘Minimum Viable Product’ (MVP) for our daily tasks and larger life goals. I’ve observed that it’s possible to craft an MVP in a mere fraction of the time initially estimated. Implementing a timer for a 5, 10, or 15-minute burst can catalyze the creation of an MVP, serving as a safeguard against the paralysis of perfectionism. It prompts me to consider—what is the MVP of my current top goal?\nIn pursuit of authenticity and understanding, I’ve made it a practice to seek the ground truth, to poke at reality rather than resting on assumptions or the allure of a well-argued point. It’s an exercise in intellectual humility and a commitment to what truly is, rather than what merely appears to be.\nThe repetition of action breeds habit, but when those actions morph into a sequence performed thrice, it’s time for systematization. Checklists emerge as a tool for efficiency, ensuring consistency and freeing up mental space for more creative or complex problem-solving.\nIn these principles, I find a potent blend of structure and flexibility. They guide me in forging a path through the day’s work, reminding me that the essence of productivity lies not in ceaseless labor, but in mindful action and the courage to confront the genuine complexities of life.\n\nRead more at: lifehacks - Alexey Guzey\nYou may also be interested in: Have Some Go to Habits"},"Notes/Cultural-and-historical-meanings-of-obesity":{"title":"idea-note","links":["Nutrition-MOC","Notes/Gut-microbes-and-brain-connections"],"tags":["health","history","weight","obesity"],"content":"This is from Peter Attia’s The Drive\n#212 - The Neuroscience of Obesity | Stephan Guyenet, Ph.D.\nGout is the rich man’s disease\nAnd I don’t think anybody would have looked down upon it too negatively.

The secret to understanding health is to realize that everything is connected. What you eat has an effect on how you feel. And how you feel affects your motivation to workout. Working out affects your mood which affects your friendships.\nIt’s a lot to take in, but I think you’re already part way there.\nThe Mental Health Examples §\nWe’re living through a mental health revolution.\nTake for example mental health. May people today understand that mental health is an important part of our wellbeing.\nWays to improve mental health §\nLook at this list\nIt’s different strategies to improve mental health\nBut they’re not just focused on the brain or the mind\nThey’re focused on different aspects of your life.\nIf you care about mental health, then you’re already on your way to understanding health very well.\nYou already understand, that to take care of your mental health, you work on every aspect of your life.\nYou can work on your mental health directly, but you can also work on it by exploring other aspects also.\nSame Idea expanded. Everything in your experience is connected §\nTake that idea from mental health, and blow that up, and you have this concept called deep health.\nThe truth is, all things in your experience are connected. Your body is connected to your mind. And also your body is connected to your relationships, and to your environment. That is the main idea for today. What makes you healthy is not just what you do in the gym. Or what you eat on your plate.\nHow much time you spend with people that care about you and support you makes you healthy. Having a connection with something larger than yourself is part of health. The city or place you live in is part of you’re health.\nSo when I say, I want to be healthy. I usually mean, I want to exercise more, and I want to eat better food. But it should also mean, that I want to cultivate supportive relationships, and I want to live in an environment that’s good for me.\nEverything goes well at the same time\nEverything goes wrong at the same time\nExample §\nLook at this example. Michael sleeps late, and he doesn’t get a good night’s sleep. He wakes up and feels cranky. Because of that, he’s mean to his friends. Sarcastic and sassy. Then he works out, he’s more likely to get injured.\nOn the other hand\nYou eat a good meal before your exam.\nAnd you’re able to perform well.\nIf you relax.\nyou don’t have indigestion.\nThis is what is called Deep Health §\n(Show the deep health diagram)\nWhat I’ve just described above is what I like to call Deep Health. It’s an idea that I borrowed from other health coaches and some counselors.\nDeep health is another way of saying that being healthy is more than being physically fit. Deep health covers all dimensions of your life, including physical fitness. And if you want to be healthy for a long time, you can try to approach it from a deep health perspective.\nWhat health researchers know is this:\n\nEverything in our lives are connected.\nIf you are thriving in one area, then other areas of your life will get “propped up”\n\nFor example, if you get a good night’s sleep (physical), you’re more likely to do well in an exam or presentation (mental), you’re also more patient and kind to people around you (relational)\n\n\nConversely, if one area is struggling, other areas can be affected as well\n\nFor example, if someone is judgemental or unsupportive of your goals (relational), it might affect your eating habits, and sleep (physical). It may even make you doubt yourself deeply (existential)\n\n\n\nAnswer the survey §\nThe Value of a Life Dashboard\nhttps://www.precisionnutrition.com/deep-health\nHere’s another footnote\nI hope you have a basic understanding of deep health now. The next step is to go over each area, and try to understand- what areas am I doing well in? What areas come naturally to me? Where do I have inherent strengths? Where do I have inherent weaknesses?\nThis will give you some idea of how to design your health pratices well.\nGoing over each area §\nGetting a “Deep health” snapshot\n(at this point, I’ll ask them to draw the diagram, and we’ll fill it up togehter)\nPhysical Health §\nPhysical health is what everyone thinks of when they think of being healthy.\nThat’s exercise and diet.\nAsk yourself here,\n\nHow do you feel about your exercise and movement right now?\nAnd how do you feel about the food that you’re eating right now?\n\nScore yourself higher here if:\nScore yourself lower her if:\nDo you have the physical freedom to do the things you want to do? Or is something holding you back? Like a bad back, or rickety knees?\nIf you’re happy with your physical health, the way you move and eat, then give yourself a higher score here. If you’d like to improve things, you can place yourself where you think you are.\nEmotional Health §\nEmotional health focuses on the question: How well can I handle my emotions? Am I able to express my emotions appropriately?\nScore yourself higher here if: §\nScore yourself lower here if: §\nThese days, how is your emotional health?\nMental Health §\nMental health over here is different from the mental health we talked about above. Here, the question to answer is, “Does my brain feel engaged by the things I am doing in my day?”\nScore yourself higher if:\n\nThese days, I feel really engaged with my work and hobbies.\nI like the problems that I’m encountering now. I like trying to solve them\nI feel stimulated during my day.\n\nScore yourself lower if:\n\nThese days I feel quite bored and uninterested\nI feel like I’m mostly doing things mindlessly\nI can’t even remember how I spent my day\n\nExistential Health §\nExistential Health talks about your sense of purpose. Do you have a goal and clear motivation for yourself. Do you know why you do the things you do?\nScore yourself higher here if:\n\nI feel like I’m building towards my future\nI can imagine\n\nScore yourself lower here if:\n\nI feel like I’m stuck\n\nRelational Health §\nRelational Health has to do with the people around you. Are you supported by close friends and relatives? Do you have people in your life that can help you with your goals?\nScore yourself high\n\nYou have someone you can talk to when you’re in distress\n\nScore yourself low if:\n\nYou feel more disconnected and isolated\nYou feel like you’re struggling alone\n\nWhat do you need from your loved ones in order to help you work on your health\nEnvironmental Health §\nEnvironmental Health has to do with the space you find yourself in. This can be many things. Are you surrounded by green and life where you live? Are you happy with your home? Your city?\nScore yourself higher here if:\n\nYour environment makes it easier for you to be health\n\nScore yourself lower here if:\n\nYou feel unsafe or insecure with where you live\nYou feel restricted by factors that are outside of your control.\n\nIs there any way to change your environment, to help you meet your goals?\nBreakout rooms will go here. §\n(How is this going to happen)\nBringing it back and getting ideas in §\nIs it Overwhelming or Empowering? §\nThe challenge is that problems are connected.\nThe good news is that solutions are connected too!\nFocus on your strengths!\nDon’t force yourself, “trick” yourself.\nRelational is strong for you?\nInstead of forcing yourself to exercise or eat well\nRecruit some friends to do it with you.\nMental is strong for you?\nInstead of forcing yourself to exercise\nWhy don’t you do some research- Study and see what you learn. This may motivate you more\n(I have booklists)\nKey takeaway for me here:\nBut the perspective I like to take is that there are many things you can do! If you can’t exercise right now, because it’s the pandemic, that’s okay. You can spend time with family- and you’re still taking care of your health by doing that.\nPull your health by focusing on different things.\nKey Idea 2: It looks different for every person §\nAnalogy §\nWho’s the healthiest here\nBodybuilder-\nFather who spends time with their kids\nStudent who hangs out with friends, volunteers at a hospital.\n—\nThe fish swim thing from Einstein\nthe image of the test?\nSomething that talks about best fit.\nIdea §\nDeep health looks different for each of us. What it means for you to be healthy is very different than what it means for me to be healthy.\nThe best example that we’re all familiar with here is the different between introverts and extroverts. An introvert will spend their night chatting with a friend online, and they can feel that their relational score for deep health is good. But for an extrovert, that might not be enough. So they would score themselves lower in that situation.\nBut for some people. It makes them self conscious. They feel awkward. They can’t focus on their movements.\nSo for different people, the social support for them to be healthy looks different.\nBut this is true for all dimensions!\nMaybe for physical exercise- you like to go on long runs. And that’s really motivating for you. But another person like to swim. Someone else likes yoga.\nThere’s no one best workout. There’s just the best workout for you.\nKey Idea 3: Try running mini-deep-health experiments. §\nAnalogy §\nI’m going to go to the gym everyday FOR THE WHOLE YEAR\nExploring and being surprised\nThe best travel stories\nCISV - You don’t know what to expect\nIdea §\nBecuase different things work for different people, you’re going to have to try out things for yourself. And to make it much less overwhelming, I found that doing small mini experiments through the year are much better to learn.\n\n\nConsider your deep health\n\n\nThink about what you’d like to work on\n\n\nI follow this template\n\n\nFor the next 10 days, I’m going to work on ((pick an area)) by trying to ((pick an activity)). ((Pick a person)) is going to help me by ((some specific way))\nTwo weeks later:\nAfter trying to ((activity)) for two weeks, I noticed that ((What worked well)). I also noticed that I struggled with ((what was difficult)). If I do this again I would consider ((some alternatives))\n—\n10 days, so that it’s not such a big commitment."},"Notes/Deep-Health-and-all-the-factors":{"title":"Deep Health and all the factors","links":[],"tags":["-holistic-health-factors-on/deep-why-deep-health"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nOn Being with Krista Tippett\nKimberley Wilson — Whole Body Mental Health\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/6299cc37e6f4a6f5a94aa92b\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nHow much of your stress or health is\nhow much sleep you’re getting\nOr what you’re eating?\nHow can we make little improvements\nHow much is relationships?\nHow much is your trauma?\nSee also §"},"Notes/Deep-Why":{"title":"Deep Why","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/motivation","tags/on/purpose"],"tags":["permanent-note","motivation","on/purpose"],"content":"topic: 202111281949- Deep Why\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#motivation#on/purpose §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nWhat’s your ‘Why’? §\nSomeone shared this video with me this week, and I love the message!\nI won’t spoil the video- go ahead and watch it first.\n\nTrain for your Life §\nMany people ask for me for tips on exercise- and when they do, I try to dig deeper as to what their motivation is. If their goal is to just to ‘get fit’- that usually isn’t enough.\nThat’s because getting fit is vague. Fit can mean different things to different people. Most people have this idea that being fit means looking good, and moving well. And while those are nice things to have, it’s better to root your practice in things that might matter more to you.\nWhat would being fit mean for you? \nIt could be:\n\nI’ll be strong enough to travel, enjoy my hobbies\nI have the energy work and be creative\nI can play with my kids (and grandkids)\n\nThese kinds of things are what really motivate us to exercise.

The freedom to step away from the daily grind, to rediscover forgotten hobbies or explore new landscapes, is alluring. But it’s not just a simple pause; it’s a complex interplay of emotional and practical considerations.\nThe emotional hurdles are real and varied: anxiety about future employment, shame for needing a break, guilt for wanting one, and even the fear that the freedom might be too seductive. These feelings aren’t just fleeting thoughts; they’re deeply ingrained narratives that can hold us back. It’s like standing on the edge of a cliff, paralyzed by the dizzying array of “what-ifs.”\nOn the flip side, the practicalities can’t be ignored. Financial stability is a big one. If you’re building a business that’s not yet profitable, the idea of taking time off might seem ludicrous. But here’s a counterintuitive thought: What if the sabbatical is what you need to recharge and come back with a fresh perspective that could turn your business around?\nThe key is to plan meticulously. Balance an extravagant month in a place like Rome with a more budget-friendly stay in Vietnam. Engage in both solo and group activities to get the best of introspection and social interaction. Reconnect with long-lost friends or family, and maybe even pick up a new skill or two.\nSo, who are you without your job or business? That’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it? A sabbatical could be the space you need to find that answer, and perhaps, in the process, you’ll also find the missing piece to make your business thrive.\n\nRead more at: How to Design a Sabbatical\nGo one level up : Professional Life MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Relaxation Mode"},"Notes/Designing-you-health-manual":{"title":"Designing you health manual","links":["Notes/Knowing-my-product"],"tags":["-on/user-manual-on/fitness-health-"],"content":"My writing (250-300 words) §\nDesigning your fitness manual\nThis would be the ultimate goal.\nSomething you can take away\nWhen it’s all over\nThis would be a product perhaps.\nThen you can redo the process\nand then you can update your manual.\nSo it’s a manual making exercise.\nKnowing my product\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/Designing-your-Life-(book)":{"title":"Designing your Life (book)","links":["Bill-Burnett","Dave-Evans"],"tags":[],"content":"Designing Your Life (book) §\n\nMetadata §\n\nFull title: Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life\nAuthor: Bill Burnett and Dave Evans\n"},"Notes/Designing-your-life's-compass":{"title":"Designing your life's compass","links":["Notes/Deep-Health-Workshop-(Talk)","Notes/North-Star-(concept)","Notes/A-Compass-and-a-Map"],"tags":[],"content":"Designing your life’s compass §\nFrom designing your life\nGetting a True north\nKnowing where you want to go\nsee also §\nIt’s like GMB’s what’s your WHY?\nand PN’s deep health existential motivation?\nDeep Health Workshop (Talk)\nRelated also to North Star (concept)\nA Compass and a Map"},"Notes/Desirable-Difficulty":{"title":"Desirable Difficulty","links":["Learning-MOC","Notes/Concepts-over-Technique-is-a-key-idea","tags/learning","tags/on/challenge","tags/on/difficulty","Notes/Workout-according-to-the-Goldilocks-principles"],"tags":["learning","on/challenge","on/difficulty"],"content":"up:: Learning MOC\nX:: Concepts over Technique is a key idea\ntags::#learning#on/challenge#on/difficulty\nnovelty::\nLink to Reference §\nurl:\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThis is the sweet spot for learning.\nIt has to be at the right difficulty.\nLearn at your level,\nor a little bit more difficult\nOtherwise, you’re not really developing\nor growing\nHow do you know what that level is?\nYou should be challenged\nbut not frustrated\nBored is not where you want to be\nLearn more with Desirable Difficulty §\nI admit, I’m addicted to quick wins.

A prevailing notion is that doctors tend to avoid aggressive treatments when facing terminal illness, opting for palliative care that focuses more on comfort and quality of life. This is backed by data indicating that hospice care may, counterintuitively, extend life compared to aggressive interventions.\nHowever, it’s crucial to recognize that this narrative isn’t a one-size-fits-all. Some doctors do fight tooth and nail, perhaps propelled by their deep-rooted knowledge or even ego. Others find a middle ground, taking a personalized journey that intertwines medical rationality with personal spirituality. Thus, while access to comprehensive information is a potent tool, it is not the sole compass guiding one’s choices at the end of life.\nInstead, perhaps the most impactful “treatment” comes from within—aligning one’s spirituality with the hard, often uncomfortable facts at hand. This is akin to blending two opposing forces: the rigidity of medical evidence and the fluidity of spiritual belief. The convergence of these elements could be seen as the health sector’s equivalent of jazz improvisation—improvising a tune on the fly, even as you read from a well-known musical score.\nSo, does the medical community’s approach to end-of-life care reflect universal wisdom or is it a form of professional bias? The answer likely lies in the individual’s personal and spiritual domain, transcending what can be captured by clinical studies or professional consensus. Making a final decision involves a personal “alchemy” that balances the known with the unknown, the physical with the spiritual.\nAnd as in any alchemical process, the end result is both transformative and deeply personal—a life choice uniquely your own.\n\nRead more at: How Doctors Die | Essay | Zócalo Public Square\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: What happens if we never die"},"Notes/Dometic-mini-freezer":{"title":"Dometic mini freezer","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dometic mini freezer §\nOverland pros"},"Notes/Don-Bosco":{"title":"Don Bosco","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Saint Don Bosco was an Italian Roman Catholic priest who dedicated his life to the education and care of disadvantaged youth in the 19th century. He is known for his innovative teaching methods and his strong belief in the value of practical, hands-on learning.\nBorn in 1815 in Turin, Italy, Don Bosco was the youngest of three children. He grew up in poverty and experienced the struggles of being a disadvantaged youth firsthand. Despite these challenges, he excelled in his studies and was eventually ordained as a priest in 1841.\nAfter his ordination, Don Bosco began working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. He quickly realized that traditional methods of education were not effective for these boys, who were often uninterested in academics and more interested in practical skills. In response, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture.\nDon Bosco’s innovative methods proved to be highly successful, and he quickly gained a reputation as a compassionate and effective educator. He also founded the Salesian Society, a group of priests and laypeople dedicated to the education and care of disadvantaged youth. The Salesian Society still exists today and has spread to countries all over the world.\nIn addition to his work with disadvantaged youth, Don Bosco was also a strong advocate for the rights of workers and was deeply involved in the labor movement of his time. He believed that education and work were key components of a fulfilling and meaningful life, and he worked tirelessly to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they needed to succeed.\nDon Bosco was beatified in 1929 and canonized as a saint in 1934. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer in education and a model of compassion and service. His legacy lives on through the work of the Salesian Society and the many people whose lives have been touched by his teachings.\n—\nOne well-known anecdote from the life of Saint Don Bosco involves a dream he had when he was a young boy. In the dream, he saw a group of boys who were lost and in danger. He tried to lead them to safety, but they kept running away from him.\nAs he chased after the boys, he was joined by a tall, handsome man who told him, “Don’t be afraid. Take these boys under your protection. Educate them, and I will help you.”\nWhen Don Bosco woke up from the dream, he was deeply moved by it and felt called to dedicate his life to the education and care of disadvantaged youth. He saw the dream as a sign from God and took it as a mission to help young people who were lost and in need of guidance.\nThis dream had a profound impact on Don Bosco’s life and shaped the course of his career as an educator. He worked tirelessly to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they needed to succeed, and his innovative teaching methods helped countless boys to achieve their potential.\n—\nOne more anecdote from the life of Saint Don Bosco involves a time when he was working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. There was a young boy named Tony who was particularly difficult to reach and seemed resistant to all of Don Bosco’s efforts to help him.\nDespite this, Don Bosco refused to give up on Tony and continued to try to reach out to him. He eventually discovered that Tony was struggling with a learning disability that made it difficult for him to keep up in school.\nRather than giving up on Tony, Don Bosco worked with him individually and found creative ways to help him learn. He used hands-on activities and practical exercises to engage Tony and help him understand the material.\nThrough his persistence and patience, Don Bosco was able to help Tony overcome his learning disability and succeed in school. This experience was just one example of the compassionate and innovative approach that Don Bosco brought to his work with disadvantaged youth.\n—\nAfter his ordination, Don Bosco began working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. He quickly realized that traditional methods of education were not effective for these boys, who were often uninterested in academics and more interested in practical skills.

He used hands-on activities and practical exercises to engage Tony and help him understand the material.\n—\nUse your hands\nWhat activity did you take up during the pandemic years?\nWas it baking? Gardening? Knitting?\nDid you learn a new instrument? Start working out? Or take up cooking?\nPersonally I picked up woodworking. It was so satisfying to cut and carve wood. Assemble it together and polish it into a finished product.\nMost of the activities that people sought during the pandemic had to do with ‘using your hands.’ We all found solace in physically making something, even from scratch.\n200 years ago, Don Bosco already knew that was true.\nHe’s among the famous saints in the Catholic tradition. Well known for being a teacher, and all the schools he inspired. During his life, he focused on the disadvantaged youth in Turin. He saw that for these troubled children, the usual way of teaching them was not working.\nSo he didn’t force it.\nInstead, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture. (Yep! Getting people to use their hands for work) That helped those struggling youth find work- but spiritually it also helped them relax, and calm down (just like it did for us in the last 3 years)\nHere in the Philippines, this is what we associate Don Bosco with- all the vocational schools and technical skills that a Don Bosco education provided.\nBut I also think we make a big mistake when we think of “Don Bosco”, “Disadvantaged Youth”, “Vocational Training”, and we immediately think “Oh that’s not me.”\nYes, you may not be a disadvantaged youth. Yes, you probably don’t do any vocational work.\nBut just for a minute, exercise your spiritual imagination a little.\nAren’t you disadvantaged, struggling, and troubled?\nI know I am.\nTechnology, media, the news fills me with anxiety\nDo you need to do some manual work?\nI know I do.\nI’m always thinking, thinking, thinking.\nBut when I use my hands and garden, I focus on where I am in that moment. Nothing but what I see and the sensations of my work.\nWork that uses my hands.\nOne of my favorite teaching from John Paul II is about work itself. He says:\n“Since work is always a personal action it follows that the whole person, body and spirit, participates in it, no matter what kind of work it is.”\nWe glamorize the preaching of Jesus, but we forget that he was also a carpenter. Someone who worked with your hands. And anyone who has made anything with their hands will tell you- that the process of creating something. Not rushing. Taking your time. Making mistakes. Learning. This has a holiness all of its own.\nJesus knew this. Don Bosco knew this.

Later, it became a tool for changing my body into something deemed better than the body I had, and that’s when rules came in, assigning moral value to different kinds of foods, calories were obsessively counted, and I got further and further away from connection to my own hunger and full cues and intuitive cravings.\nTo me, a major theme of my last book was that sometimes things that cause short-term boosts can undermine long-term development. But — human intuition being what it is — it’s hard to internalize the idea of a short/long-term tradeoff.\nThat’s interesting because what looks like elite performance is not healthy.\nOr rather what we imagine health to be is the elite performance variety. But there are so many quality of life tradeoffs that are being made when someone wants to be elite in that way.\nThat reminds me of Post Athlete life almost always reverts to mean\nIt’s similar because I remember when I was an athlete, I felt like I was just going to perform and be healthy forever and ever. But of course that’s not true. It’s so hard to imagine in the moment that it isn’t going to last forever, even though you know that conceptually.\nIt’s different because I was never as elite as Lauren Fleshman. Because I didn’t make all the sacrficies. Maybe intuitively I already knew what the tradeoffs were and didn’t want to go there.\nIt’s important because if someone wants to be healthy today, there’s way more that goes into that than just being elite.

However, compelling insights from the article “How to Reason With Your Body” as well as figures like George Soros and Einstein challenge this notion. They introduce the idea that kinesthetic awareness—the physical, bodily understanding of the world around you—is not just useful but essential for robust reasoning and problem-solving.\nEinstein and Soros exemplify this kinesthetic awareness in their respective fields. Soros, for instance, claimed that his back would “act up” if something were wrong in the markets. A bodily signal as a barometer for external events? Fascinating. It almost suggests that our bodies might be more attuned to the nuances of our environment than we give them credit for.\nThe Feeling of Thinking §\nI’ve noticed that when I move—when I physically engage with the world—my thinking becomes richer, more nuanced. I ‘feel’ my way through problems, just as the speaker in the article described. My body becomes an active participant in the process, a contributor to the “thinking,” if you will. For me, this isn’t about relegating cognition to some cerebral ivory tower; it’s about incorporating the full experience of being a living, moving being into how I approach the world.\nThe Spectrum of Awareness §\nThe idea here isn’t to downplay intellectual or cerebral reasoning. On the contrary, it’s about recognizing that reasoning exists on a spectrum that involves the whole body. You don’t have to be ‘all in your head’ or ‘all in your body.’ A balanced approach yields a more holistic understanding of challenges and opportunities.\nExpanding the Toolbox §\nThis concept of “reasoning with the body” encourages us to expand our toolbox of cognitive strategies. If bodily signals can help Soros gauge market shifts, or help Einstein understand the workings of the universe, just think what integrating bodily awareness could do for your decision-making and problem-solving.\n\nRead more at: Adam Robinson #168\nYou may also be interested in: Focusing on Meaningful Movement"},"Notes/Embody-to-Become--The-Alchemy-of-'Acting-As-If'":{"title":"Embody to Become: The Alchemy of 'Acting As If'","links":["Notes/Embodied-Cognition--More-Than-a-Brain-in-a-Jar"],"tags":["behavioral-psychology","growth-mindset","self-image","12-step-programs"],"content":"The principle of “acting as if” is more than just a psychological trick; it’s a transformative behavioral model that encourages you to embody the mindset and actions congruent with your desired outcome. This isn’t about pretending; it’s about aligning your behaviors and thought patterns with the person you aim to become, thereby accelerating your evolution into that identity.\nHaving experienced the power of this principle in 12-step programs, I can attest to its effectiveness. In such programs, you don’t achieve sobriety and then act sober; you act sober, and that catalyzes your sobriety. The power of ‘acting as if’ lies in its capacity to reverse-engineer your self-image and aspirations into tangible behaviors.\nAdler, a noted psychologist, proposed that this method is particularly effective for overcoming feelings of inferiority. And it’s easy to see why. By assuming the role of a more confident, capable version of yourself, you gradually adopt a growth mindset. This mindset shift acts as a catalyst, propelling you out of stagnation and into a state of continuous growth and adaptability.\nWhat is fascinating is that this principle doesn’t just shift your self-image; it modifies your actions and decisions in a way that makes you adaptable and willing to step out of your comfort zones. This creates a feedback loop that continuously reinforces your new self-image and capabilities.\nThe principle has proven its worth in various contexts, from personal development courses to addiction recovery programs. Acting as if you’re already the person you aspire to become isn’t about delusion; it’s about embodying change and setting in motion a series of events that make your desired outcome inevitable.\n\nRead more at: The Power of “Acting as If” - by Steven Schlafman\nYou may also be interested in: Embodied Cognition- More Than a Brain in a Jar"},"Notes/Embracing-Dietary-Variety--The-Power-of-Mushrooms-Against-Cancer":{"title":"Embracing Dietary Variety: The Power of Mushrooms Against Cancer","links":["Notes/The-problem-of-nutrition-and-not-just-calories"],"tags":["nutrition","diversity","mushrooms","fungi","cancer","health","simplicity"],"content":"In the midst of a world teeming with complex dietary advice, the essence of health could be beautifully simple—diversity on our plates. A compelling study I encountered, titled “Higher Mushroom Consumption Is Associated With Lower Risk of Cancer” from ScienceDirect, reveals a fascinating correlation: more mushrooms, less cancer. This isn’t a tale of magical fungi, but a narrative supported by a systematic review, highlighting particularly how breast cancer rates dip with increased mushroom intake. Isn’t it profound how nature offers us such potent tools in the guise of ordinary foods?\nIt’s almost like a dance with biological diversity, where each step—the foods we choose—matters. I believe that it’s not about meticulously calculating each nutrient; rather, it’s about welcoming a spectrum of natural foods into our diet. Mushrooms, in this case, exemplify how something so common could wield power against something as formidable as cancer.\nIn my practice, I always nudge towards simplicity. The variety isn’t just the spice of life; it seems to be its guardian too. By keeping our plates as colorful and varied as the world around us, we might just be fortifying our bodies in ways we’re only beginning to understand.\n\nRead more at: Higher Mushroom Consumption Is Associated with Lower Risk of Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies - ScienceDirect\nYou may also be interested in: The problem of nutrition and not just calories"},"Notes/Embracing-Fear-as-a-Creative-Catalyst":{"title":"Embracing Fear as a Creative Catalyst","links":["Maps/Creator-Economy-MOC","Notes/Writing-helps-you-be-creative"],"tags":["fear","creativity","personal-growth","mindset"],"content":"Fear is a constant companion in the creative process, not an obstacle to be completely eradicated. It’s akin to a shadow that follows you, regardless of how much light you shine on your work. The key isn’t to eliminate the fear but to get comfortable with it, to make it a part of your creative DNA.\nConsider the journey from a handful of views to millions. The emotional landscape doesn’t shift as dramatically as the numbers do. You might think hitting a milestone will vanquish your fears, but in reality, the fear remains. It’s not about the numbers; it’s about the act of creating itself.\nHere’s a question I often ponder: What’s worse, the fear of creating something that no one sees or the fear of not creating at all? The latter is a silent killer, eroding your potential day by day.\nThis is why practice is non-negotiable. It’s like hiking a trail you’ve never been on before. The first time, every rustle in the bushes makes you jump. But as you walk it again and again, you become familiar with the sounds, the terrain, and even your own internal rhythms of fear and excitement. You never stop being cautious, but you do stop being paralyzed.\nRemember, if you’re not creating because you’re scared, you’re not getting used to the fear. You’re letting it win. So, the next time fear whispers in your ear, acknowledge it, thank it for its concern, and then proceed to do the work anyway. Because the work is where you grow, and growth is where you find your freedom.\nThis matters to me because I’ve felt the weight of this fear, and I know I’m not alone. Even seasoned professionals feel it. The difference is, they’ve made peace with it.

When it comes to product development, there’s an art to knowing when your product or service has reached the “good enough” point. It’s tempting to polish everything to perfection, but doing so may be a futile endeavor and a time sink.\nOne thing I’ve realized is the importance of selling even when things aren’t picture-perfect. It’s through the selling process that we gain invaluable insights into what actually needs improvement.\nThe framework for iteration is simple:\n\nMake your product sellable, not perfect.\nSell it to someone.\nCollect feedback and iterate.\n\nThe idea is not to put off selling until all the t’s are crossed and i’s dotted. You need to get your product out there, in the hands of customers who can offer feedback. Waiting for perfection is a form of procrastination. It’s a roadblock I’ve observed many entrepreneurs, including myself, get stuck at.\nDon’t get me wrong—there’s a time and place for “all the other business stuff” like logo creation and branding. But it shouldn’t come at the expense of learning and iterating from actual sales and customer interactions.\nRemember, a product in isolation is just a concept; its real value is revealed only when it interacts with the market. It’s essential to keep this feedback loop short and active. The quicker you can iterate, the quicker you’ll build something that people not only want but will pay for.\nIn essence, accept the imperfection as a part of the process, not a hindrance. The objective is growth through iteration, fueled by real-world feedback. And trust me, there’s nothing more enlightening than a customer telling you what they think.\n\nRead more at: Letting Go of Perfection: Embracing Imperfection in Design | by Niki Tisza | Oct, 2023 | UX Planet\nYou may also be interested in: Knowing my product"},"Notes/Embracing-the-Art-of-\"Showing-Up\"-in-the-World-of-Entrepreneurship":{"title":"Embracing the Art of \"Showing Up\" in the World of Entrepreneurship","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","Notes/The-High-Income-Skills-Symphony-in-Modern-Entrepreneurship"],"tags":["entrepreneurship","finance","resilience","opportunities"],"content":"In the world of entrepreneurship, one valuable strategy stands out—a relentless commitment to “showing up.” This slow grind approach is not about instant results but a steady accumulation of effort, akin to a marathon rather than a sprint.\nAs an entrepreneur, the transition away from the security of a bi-monthly paycheck can be nerve-wracking. The volatility of net worth in this new landscape is undeniable. Surprisingly, even during the highs and lows of financial life, the worry about money remains a constant companion. It becomes clear that financial anxiety is often independent of the actual balance in one’s bank account once basic needs are met.\nDespite the hardships, there’s an essential truth to grasp here. If you consistently show up, deliver value, exhibit decency, and apply your intellect, opportunities have a way of gravitating towards you. It’s not an immediate solution but a path that demands resilience and unwavering commitment.\nThe journey may be tough and stressful, but it’s in the persistence and continuous presence that the seeds of success are sown.\n\nRead more at: Life after “Golden Handcuffs” | RadReads\nGo one level up : Entrepreneurship MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The High-Income Skills Symphony in Modern Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/Embracing-the-Longevity-of-a-Well-Lived-Life":{"title":"Embracing the Longevity of a Well-Lived Life","links":["Notes/The-Bills-of-Mortality"],"tags":["gratitude","life-lessons","wellness","mortality"],"content":"The idea that ”a life, if lived well, is long enough” serves as a powerful reminder of the intrinsic value of life itself. It challenges our societal notion that longer is inherently better and reframes our understanding of life’s worth around the quality of our experiences and actions.\nWhether it’s the awe we feel when we travel or the marvel of our physical bodies in action, these moments crystallize the essence of a life well-lived. Travel isn’t just about ticking off destinations; it’s a chance to soak up the world’s grandeur, to reset our perspectives and find awe in the otherwise mundane.\nFrom a health standpoint, the emphasis on staying active aligns seamlessly with the biological truth that the human body is a marvel of engineering, capable of incredible feats when nurtured properly. As someone who has felt the weight of inertia and the thrill of physical engagement, I can say that there’s something deeply empowering about using our bodies the way they’re designed to be used. It’s like giving a nod to our human ingenuity.\nThe concept also touches on a more somber note, a reminder that mortality is a part of the equation. It nudges us to act, to live vibrantly, and to be grateful for the time and capabilities we have. It hits hard: we should be extraordinarily grateful for our bodies and the experiences they allow us. It’s as if life is saying, “If you do it right, once is enough.”\nRemembering this idea that a life well-lived is sufficient in itself can serve as a compass in navigating the seas of life’s uncertainties, reminding us to savor the moments that truly matter.\n\nRead more at: At 31, I have just weeks to live.

Without focus, life drifts from stimuli to stimuli, with very little consistent Direction (re Flow).\nResidual Attention — Your attention isn’t just about what you are thinking about right now; it’s more so composed of everything that’s entered your mind over past 72 hours.\n\nSimilar Keywords: Attentional Residue, Echo, Resonating, Ripples, Shadows, Reflections, Glimmers, Whispers, Deja Vu, Attention Robbers, Attentional Switching, Distraction Radiation, Distraction Amnesia, Continuity of Thought\n\n\n\nMain Factors Governing Attention §\n\nIntensity and Frequency of Distractions\n\nSurroundings and Environment\n\n\nQuality of Diet\n\nCauses of Poor Attention §\n\nDistractions — Distractions come in many forms and factors. Below is a list of major sources of distraction to safeguard against:\nPoor Diet — Sugar makes people act impulsively; they become more susceptible to distractions. Grains can cause brain fog to lowers mood and Enthusiasm. Both dramatically raise blood sugar levels causing the secretion of Insulin. The resulting fall of blood glucose levels causes hunger, irritability, and energy crashes.\nAverage Diet — Even an average diet can still have several micro-nutrient deficiencies that can be the cause of headaches, lower Energy (re Flow) levels, mood swings, a lack of enthusiasm.\nLack of Enthusiasm (re Flow)\nLack of Direction (re Flow)\n\nSolutions to Poor Attention §\n\nReducing Distractions in Intensity and Frequency\nHaving a Good Diet\n"},"Notes/Enjoying-exercise-vs-expectations-of-others":{"title":"Enjoying exercise vs expectations of others","links":["Notes/Athletes-and-Mental-Health","Notes/Taking-more-control-of-your-health-good-or-bad"],"tags":["-on/enjoyment-exercise-self-expression-self-image-on/self-actualization--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nAnne Helen Petersen\nurl: https://twitter.com/annehelen/status/1552473187891326977\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nBut it is not a coincidence that I started really loving running &amp; strength when I started engaging and disposing of shitty fatphobia ideas about my body and others - letting go of the weird cardio fetish is honestly amazing\nSee also §\nAthletes and Mental Health\nTaking more control of your health good or bad"},"Notes/Enjoyment-is-more-important-than-efficient-(concept)":{"title":"Enjoyment is more important than efficient (concept)","links":["Notes/Don't-push-yourself,-pull-yourself","Notes/Obsessive-passion-and-Harmonious-passion"],"tags":[],"content":"Enjoyment is more important than efficient (concept) §\nPick the physical activity that you like\nSo enjoyment as a factor again incredibly important.\nChange things up when you’re bored.\nsee also §\nDeveloping a pull system\nDon’t push yourself, pull yourself\nObsessive passion and Harmonious passion"},"Notes/Enjoyment-vs-pleasure":{"title":"Enjoyment vs pleasure","links":["Notes/The-Gym-is-enjoyable-not-pleasurable"],"tags":["-on/enjoyment-pleasure-mindset-on/healthy-mindsets--"],"content":"My writing (250-300 words) §\nEnjoyment and pleasure are terms often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing.

O2 levels increase. CO2 levels decrease. pH levels increase (and surprisingly stay higher than what’s normal even after breath-holding, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe they are associated with pH drops.\nO2:CO2 Ratio &amp; pH Levels:\n\nA normal ratio is 4:1 &amp; pH: 7.40\nDuring hyperventilation, the ratio goes up to 11:1 &amp; pH: 7.70\nDuring hypoventilation, the ratio goes down to 1:1 &amp; pH: 7.50\n\nInteresting note: Even after breath-holding, pH levels stay surprisingly higher than normal, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe the detriments that are talked about are always associated with drops in pH. Hence, if pH stays above normal, all should be good. I’d love to get some expert opinions on this.\n\nResearch Link\n\nLactate Levels:\n\nA normal range is 0.5 - 1.5 mmol/L. The test subject’s baseline was 0.70.\nDuring hyperventilation, it only increased to 1.15 mmol/L.\nDuring hypoventilation, it lowered to 0.90 mmol/L.\n\nFor comparison a 15-45 second sprint shows lactate levels rising way up to 8-15 mmol/L. So, there is no worry for the minuscule rise in lactate levels from hyper-hypoventilation.\n\nResearch Link\n\nBenefit # 1: POSITIVE HORMONAL RESPONSE AND A (SUPPOSED) INCREASED IMMUNE SYSTEM. §\nThis act stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline (just like taking a cold shower, which also forces us to hyperventilate a bit), and has been shown to benefit the immune system.\nBenefit # 2: MINDFULNESS §\nBoth conscious “over-breathing” and the conscious breath-holding act as a fast and simple form of mindfulness for me, getting me out of racing thoughts in the prefrontal cortex, and—due to the hormonal release—allowing my brain stem and more primitive parts of the brain (such as the pituitary gland) to activate without invoking worry and stress (I admit things get unclear for me here, so I’d like to hear more on this). Regardless, I’m more calm, centered, and clear-minded afterwards.\nBenefit # 3: EUPHORIC FEELING §\nBreathing in excess O2 leads to tingling fingers and lightheadedness. It also creates a slightly euphoric feeling. Is that weird?\nPART 2 §\nThen after elevating my O2 levels, that’s when I hold my breath, which I imagine completely moves the O2:CO2 ratio in the opposite relationship — like a seesaw. And in the process, it leads to:\nBenefit # 4: WILLPOWER BOOST §\nIt gives a sense of control. And my belief is that a SENSE of control is a main factor in willpower and happiness. (Whether or not we really have any real control is a separate debate.) Since this odd activity increases my sense of control, it increases my sense of happiness.\nBenefit # 5: ANTI-FRAGILITY §\nStressing the mind and body (safely) leads to the overcompensation effect. That’s why we adapt to heavy weights by getting stronger (to throw out a common example).\nMajor Concern §\nDoes this pattern of Hyperventilation/Retention cause any harm? There are a few studies covering Wim Hof and his method that show clear results (see below), but much more research is needed.\nAnybody have other takes, insights, research, commentary, or suggestions on this?\nResearch Link : http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full\n\nNote on Lactate Levels\nLactic acid is a product of cell metabolism that can accumulate when cells lack sufficient oxygen (hypoxia) and must turn to a less efficient means of energy production, or when a condition causes excess production or impaired clearance of lactate.\nDepending on pH, it is sometimes present in the form of lactic acid. However, with the neutral pH maintained by the body, most lactic acid will be present in the blood as lactate.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2015-12-03\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Expose-and-adapt-vs-Correct-and-Protect":{"title":" Expose and adapt vs Correct and Protect ","links":["Notes/Antifragility","Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/How-to-be-more-confident-in-your-injury-recovery--and-why-being-confident-makes-a-big-difference"],"tags":["-expose-","-injury-","-recovery-","-adapting-"],"content":"I like this idea,\nI’ve been applying it to my own training\nit’s contrasted with correct and protect\nSomething that’s stronger once it’s been broken\nLink this to Antifragility\nWhat is it? §\nThat if you want to deal with pain, one strategy is to expose yourself to some new movements.\nThis way your body doesn’t have any fear associated with moving.\nThe body can adapt to many things.\nYou can trust your own body to get better.\nWhy is it important? §\nBecause we’re always dealing with pain in one way shape or form.\nAt least here, it means you don’t have to just hide\n\nRead more at: Podcast With Greg Lehman — BETTER MOVEMENT\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: How to be more confident in your injury recovery- and why being confident makes a big difference"},"Notes/External-cues-vs-Internal-cues":{"title":"External cues vs Internal cues","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"External cues vs Internal cues §\nIt’s generally accepted that external cues work better than internal cues\ntry to find external cues\nBecause you can’t really describe what is in the body so well?\nIsrael Halperin\nBetter movement podcast"},"Notes/External-vs-Internal-Attentional-Focus":{"title":"External vs Internal Attentional Focus","links":["Inner-Game-of-Tennis","Self-2","Visualizing-an-Outcome","Motor-Control-and-Learning:-A-Behavioral-Emphasis","Gabriele-Wulf"],"tags":[],"content":"Internal Focus and External Focus §\nContext §\nThis is about learning and how to develop new skills\nWhat is it §\nInternal focus\n\nYou focus on your own body.

It might seem like these situations only arise in rare, crucial moments. But Phil Knight’s choice to face his fear is just a larger-than life version of a choice you make all the time.\nNote: What am I afraid of, and what am I avoiding? What causes me fear and anxiety? Can I practice facing that properly?\nThe practice of exposure follows from what we already know about fear: the best way to get over fear is to face it. But it turns out that not all exposure is created equal—there are ways to effectively optimize your exposure so that you can maximize your chances for actually reducing your fear and making sure it doesn’t come back.\nNote: Keep exposing yourself to scary situations- but do it in an optimal, planned out, and reflective way.\nRather than aiming for fear reduction, exposures should aim for surprise.\nNote: This is counterintuitive and powerful. Instead of being outcome based, practice being open to surprises!\nIn my experience, it’s that willingness that makes the key difference. When I’m truly willing to feel the emotion, whatever was troubling me feels a little bit less imminent, and a little bit less sticky than it did before—and I’m able to move through it more fluidly.\nNote: This is general advice on how to approach an exposure experience.\n\nRead more at: Fear, Courage, and Willingness - Superorganizers - Every\nGo one level up : Health Mindsets MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Change is Hard, don’t pretend it isn’t"},"Notes/Fail-fast-and-fail-forward":{"title":"Fail fast and fail forward","links":["Failure-is-an-option!-Designing-your-fitness-life-(Blog-Post)"],"tags":[],"content":"Fail fast and fail forward §\nFailure is an option!

Not to have it- but to be able to spend it. Anytime. Whenver you want. To do whatever you want. Money isn’t the end in itself- it’s about freedom.

To look good? To feel good?\nI’d argue that it’s to do whatever you want to do. The point of health is to be able to spend it anytime. To do whatever you need to do. Whenever you want to move you can. You’re not held back by your body- and the things that your body is limiting you from doing.\nHealth is about freedom.

However he came about plotting the two variables against each, it’s a landmark discovery. It’s a lodestar to which I keep returning. It’s the foundation much of my thinking and to my carving of that theory to practical, moment-to-moment application.\n\nLater on, Dr. Mihaly used this version to show the different states of mind plotted on the map of Challenge vs Skill.\n\nWhat is my Contribution to Flow Theory? §\nMy contribution to Flow Theory is just to expand on using the Flow Map as a practical tool to adjust one’s state of mind as needed—usually to create the Conditions of Flow (FlowCreation Theory).\nBasically, Mihaly’s Flow Map can be used many times a day as a simple tool to identify one’s current state of mind. That’s the easy part.\nThe second part is all about how to take that knowledge to improve one’s state of mind—ideally by getting closer to a feeling of a high quality experience—what Mihaly calls “optimal experience,” which is none other than Flow.\nSo you can use the Flow Map as a “State of Mind” Map—a useful guide to manage your state of mind from moment to moment.\n\nFind your current state of mind—Maybe ask, “What am I feeling?” or “Where’s my head at?”\nCreate the Conditions of Flow—This is where we can develop some FlowCreation Theory skills and tactics.\n\nSay, someone is anxious: they can point to “Anxiety” on the Flow Map and then have a few ideas how to get closer to “Optimal Experience” (Flow). See below:\nThe obvious answer for creating the Conditions of Flow is to reduce the level of Challenge or to increase the level of Skill (as the map above shows).\n\nThe less obvious answer is HOW. That’s about developing some awareness and skills, along with having some tools and tactics handy.

Here is an example of each:\n\n“I’m Anxious, I’m feeling confused.” Do I know what to focus on right now? Am I doing the thing I should be doing right now? If this is the issue, then my Direction isn’t solid. How can I improve my clarity about what to do? How can I reduce the amount of competing actions to take?\n“I’m Anxious, my mind is scattered.” What’s my environment like; am I getting interrupted too much? If so, then my Attention is suffering. How can I reduce the intensity and frequency of these distractions?\n“I’m not excited about anything, I’m apathetic.” I need to reconnect to some Enthusiasm. What gets me excited or motivated? How can I reconnect with that?\n“I’m tired, I have a headache, everything feels like too much.” Why are my Energy levels down? What needs to be improved out of the following: quality of sleep, diet, exercise, leisure time, and/or relationships?\n\nFour Factors of Flow §\nI have found that using the Flow Map to find your current State of Mind is a valuable exercise to improving it. Equally valuable is using it to find any glaring weaknesses in the elements that help create a good State of Mind. I have found that there are essentially Four Factors of Flow. They are: Direction (re Flow), Attention (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow), and Energy (re Flow). The best way to improve your experience is to identify what you’re lacking, and then taking actions to strengthen that area."},"Notes/Flowers-leaves-or-roots-(Blog-Draft)":{"title":"Flowers leaves or roots (Blog Draft)","links":["Notes/The-timing-of-festivals-and-dictating-seasons","How-plants-direct-their-energy"],"tags":[],"content":"Flowers, leaves, or roots (Blog Draft) §\nSource §\n\n??\nAs a note, I can’t find single sources for a lot of the homesteading things\n\nKey Idea §\nWhen growing plants you have to choose among these things\nWhen we got our new calamansi plant, it was already starting to have a few fruits on it.

When we talk about fluid frameworks in the “Linking Your Thinking” System, we’re mainly referring to higher-order notes like MOCs and the Home note (but a balanced use of MOCs, folders, tags, and queries can also maintain a fluid structure).\nFluid frameworks are not mutually exclusive. That means a note with its link in an MOC, doesn’t exclusively live in the MOC note. A note can live and link freely. A note can be discovered in as many places as it’s referenced. These are the fundamentals of linking notes together.\nNow with higher-order notes like MOCs, we can fluidly add any structure, at any time. But these frameworks offer unique attributes to allow us to work more fluidly than ever before.\nFluid Frameworks vs Rigid Frameworks §\nWow…So a fluid framework is a non-essential supporting structure.\nWhereas, a typical framework—like a folder—is an essential supporting structure. Delete the folder, and you delete the files within.\nAnd that’s because folders are not fluid; they are a rigid framework. They reduce the number of ways you have to access the notes trapped within. Now it’s worth noting, we do have Global Search, and we can link to notes within folders…so that’s better than it used to be…but there is still no removing the friction that comes from having to twirl down folders X, Y, and Z, just to get to Idea Omega.)\nSo even though folders alone are rigid, if you expertly use Fluid Frameworks—i.e. HIGHER-ORDER NOTES—to support your linked knowledge, then you can also work back in some smart applications of folders.\nThat’s why we’re here: to become skilled and confident with how we are deploying the tools that we have to structure our notes in the best way possible.\n\n\nSee the inspiration for using the term “fluid” at Fluid Taxonomies.\nFor more see: Benefits of LYT frameworks\n"},"Notes/Fluid-Taxonomies":{"title":"Fluid Taxonomies","links":["Notes/LYT-Kit","tags/pkm","Steen-Comer","tags/source/quote","Notes/Fluid-Frameworks"],"tags":["pkm","source/quote"],"content":"up:: LYT Kit\ntags::#pkm\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nSome content and links have been removed.\n\n\nFluid Taxonomies §\nFluid Taxonomies is a term coined by Steen Comer, which came up in our conversations about MOCs and other ways of managing knowledge.\nSteen wrote:\n\nFluid Taxonomies\nThe notion that in a loosely-ordered system like a ZK, you can apply taxonomies in an on again, off again way, and not be beholden to any of them for longer than they are useful.\n\n[These taxonomies] are useful abstractions, ways of arranging information to provide paths for specific purposes.\nAll of them have advantages and disadvantages. Most notably, all of them fail to give you the serendipity of search that most [zettlekasten] options traditionally have. Which is fine, depending on what you’re trying to do.\nMake sure you keep in mind that whatever taxonomy you’re using is not True, it’s just a tool.\nIt occurs to me, another way of thinking about this is that you’re applying hierarchies, like a file system directory tree, but they’re being applied in such a way that does not limit the data to staying in those hierarchies.\n[Consider] the metaphor of a functioning collective. You put a hierarchy in place (like an MOC), for as long as it’s useful. And then when it’s not useful, the members of that hierarchy rearrange their power structure to suit the new purpose.\nThen to summarize the conversation, Steen riffed on the Discordian quote:\n\n“All models are True in some sense, False in some sense, and Meaningless in some sense”#source/quote\n\nSteen is one of those people who makes you think.

However, once a baby enters the picture, it’s not just about optimizing yourself anymore; it’s about optimizing the family unit. The challenge suddenly expands from a personal sphere to a collective one.\nHow can I be the best husband and father? What frameworks and strategies can be employed to ensure the wellbeing of the family as a whole, especially the health of my wife and child? These are the questions that naturally come up and they force us to look at life through a different lens. Not just through my eyes but through the eyes of my wife and my baby.\nThere’s a transition from a solo game to a team sport. The key to this new paradigm is understanding that “best practices” no longer apply just to you. Rather, they need to be adaptable to cater to the differing needs and rhythms of each family member. It’s a complex and ongoing experiment that requires attention, love, and strategic planning.\nAnd let’s be real—I resonate with this deeply. Navigating this new territory of fatherhood and husbandry challenges me to extend the boundaries of my own ‘optimization mindset’ beyond myself. It is making me think beyond the individual and into the collective.\nIt’s not just an expansion of responsibility; it’s an expansion of mindset and capacity to love, which in turn, expands the joy and satisfaction we derive from life.\n\nRead more at: URL\nYou may also be interested in: How we unconsciously parent"},"Notes/Focusing-on-Meaningful-Movement":{"title":"Focusing on Meaningful Movement","links":["Maps/Chronic-Pain-MOC","Notes/Play-is-a-state-of-Mind"],"tags":["-pain-","-chronic-pain","movement","health"],"content":"When you’re stuck in an injury mindset, it’s easy to get caught up in the negative. (As we talked about last time)\nBut one thing that injury does give is the chance to ask a very important question to yourself:\nAnd that question is “Why would I care to get back into action?” \nIt sounds like an obvious question- but diving into it may reveal something to you. It can help you understand your mindset when it comes to injury, recovery, and what you value.\n“Why does movement matter to you?”\nMaybe you love the way it makes you feel. The way it boosts your energy levels, or the way it helped you stay fit and healthy. \nMaybe you love the goal setting. You love performing well and hitting your targets. You love reaching new heights.\nMaybe it matters for you to stay healthy for your family. Or the people in your life who rely on you.\nIf you have kids, maybe they need you to be healthy and active so you can chase them around and play with them. \nIf you have a partner, they may appreciate having an active partner to share activities with. \nAnd if you have friends who love to exercise, they’re probably missing your company on their runs or hikes.\nRemembering that there are people in your life who want you to be active can be a strong incentive to get moving again. \n//\nIn 2008, when tore my ACL, I was at the peak of my game. I was one of the best college track and field athletes in the country.\nMy injury was bad luck, but I had tasted being one of the best. I wanted to do everything I could do to get back to the top.\nSo I saw the doctors, I did the exercises, I trained hard to get back into things.\nThen in 2010 I tore my other ACL.\nThis time it was different. I was nearing the end of my college career. I was thinking about doing other things apart from sports. I didn’t care anymore about staying at the top of my performance.\nSo I went through the process of recovery, like last time.\nBut to be honest with you, moving and exercising was never the same again.\nMy whole life, I found meaning to exercise through competition. I wanted to beat my competitors, and I wanted to be the best.\nWhen that went away after my 2nd big injury, I couldn’t find anything that made me want to move and exercise anymore.\n//\nI lived with that struggle for 10 years.\nI had no idea what kind of exercise I wanted to do. Especially since I didn’t want to get injured again. There was too much frustration.\nNo matter how careful you are, or how much you prepare, there’s always the chance you’ll get injured. \nIt’s the reality of life. \nI don’t know anyone who has gone through their entire life without any kind of injury at all.\nIt’s impossible.\nIn the journey to finding movement again- and movement that is meaningful, there are a few ways of thinking that I find valuable.\n\nWhat movement makes it worth it?\nWhat movement feels like play?\nWhat movements do I want to explore?\n\n//\nWhat movements make it worth it?\nWhen it comes to figuring out what you want to do, it can be a tough journey. And people who have a sport they’re passionate about are very lucky\nRecently, I have started asking the question, “If I will continue to have some form of pain, what are the movements that I really care about, and would be worth working through my injury problems for”\nIf I have anxieties about injury and pain- so what activities can I do that would make it worthwhile for me? \nI have to choose something I love, so that if I get hurt and injured, I’ll find a way to keep growing and exploring.\nThese are very personal, and different for each of us.\nFor me, there is nothing I love more than when I’m hiking in the forest. And I would love to keep healthy and fit to be able to hike throughout my life.\nI have worked with someone who loves scuba diving, and her purpose in staying active and healthy is for that. Even when she has an injury or a setback, she’s eager to recover for her love of scuba diving.\nFor some, meaningful movement is biking and playing at the park with their kids. For some meaningful movement is finishing a marathon. There are so many possibilities for meaningful movement.\n//\nWhat feels like play?\nIt’s no secret that I’m a big fan of play. \nKids play all the time. They make up games and move around. But we forget how to play when we become adults. \nThis doesn’t mean you go back to your childhood games.\nIt’s more about asking:\n\nWhat are movements that let me explore?\nWhat are movements that let me be creative?\nWhat are movements that I find fun?\n\nInstead of thinking of play as a waste of time, think of play as something that is essential to our well being. It makes us more open and more creative.\nAfter all, even as adults, we still want to stay connected to our sense of wonder and our capacity for joy.\n//\nFind the fun\nHowever, there is one factor that I believe is more important than any other when it comes to choosing an exercise routine: the “fun factor.”\nYour chances of sticking to an exercise program are much higher if you choose something that you actually enjoy.\nIf you hate running, there’s no point in forcing yourself to go for a run every day. \nBut if you enjoy hiking, then make that a part of your routine. \nOr if you like playing in the playground, see if you can find a way to incorporate that into your workout.\nThe bottom line is that you should try to find an activity that feels like play rather than work. When you enjoy yourself, it’s much easier to stick with it.\nSo next time you’re wondering what exercise you should do, ask yourself this question: “What feels like play to me?” And then go do that.\n//\nA chance to explore\nFinally, getting injured, and being stuck in an injury mindset led down the path of exploring what it is that I love to do. It took me 10 years to break out of that mindset! (I don’t want it to take so long for you)\nSometimes, an injury can give you a chance to ask new questions and explore new things.\nThe best thing you can do is to be mentally flexible and adapt. If things don’t happen as you plan, try taking a different path.\nIt’s not always easy, but it’s important to lead you to discover the movement that is meaningful for you.\n//\nIn the end you have to find your WHY\nWhat is that thing that motivates you to keep on going forward\nMaybe it’s the sense of camaraderie you feel with your teammates. \nOr the feeling of accomplishment you get when you finally complete that difficult workout. \nOr maybe the vision of your kids and grandkids playing with you on the floor\nWhatever it is, finding that deeper meaning will help you stay motivated and focused on your recovery.\nThe road to recovery can be long and difficult. But it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. There are many others who have been in your shoes and come out the other side. Reach out to them for support and advice. When you’re ready to start moving again, they’ll be there to help you every step of the way.\n\nWatch more at: Fetching Title#iisw\nGo one level up : Chronic Pain MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Play is a state of Mind"},"Notes/Folgezettel---100a.1-Showing-How-Folgezettel-Works":{"title":"Folgezettel - 100a.1 Showing How Folgezettel Works","links":["Notes/Folgezettel---100a.1a-But-Also-How-It"],"tags":[],"content":"If you’re looking at this note, I’m just trying to show you in 20 seconds how rigid Folgezettel is.

It’s amusing, in a way—how the same video, the same wisdom can pop up in various trainings, each viewing bringing a hint of déjà vu, bordering on Stockholm syndrome. Yet, the core message remains crucial.\nBrown’s work, often centered on vulnerability and courage, echoes through the corridors of personal development and coaching with good reason. Though it’s been reiterated many times, its significance doesn’t wane; it’s a message that finds us at different moments in our life journey.\nIn my practice, acknowledging the varied timing of when such wisdom lands for each individual is vital. What seems like a repeated mantra may strike someone deeply for the first time, providing much-needed insight or solace. It underscores a profound aspect of human connection: we are all learners in different stages, and a familiar lesson may be someone else’s newfound revelation.\nAs a coach, it’s my responsibility to ensure that these timeless messages are not just recited, but actively integrated into my approach. Empathy and compassion, no matter how often they are spoken of, hold the power to transform lives. Recognizing the right moment to introduce these concepts can make all the difference to someone who is struggling.\nBy keeping this in mind, we honor the individual paths of discovery and remain prepared to offer support that can be both healing and empowering—no matter how familiar the advice may seem to us.\nBrené Brown on Empathy vs Sympathy - YouTube\n\nRead more at: How to Support Someone Who is Struggling — LessWrong\nYou may also be interested in: Self-Compassion is a Nutrition Gamechanger"},"Notes/Fostering-Spatial-Intelligence-in-Children":{"title":"Fostering Spatial Intelligence in Children","links":["Notes/The-Emotional-Landscape-of-Feeding-Kids--It-Takes-a-Village"],"tags":["child-development","learning","learning-strategies","cognitive-skills","education","educational-methods"],"content":"Nurturing Independence for Cognitive Growth\nWhile delving into the intricacies of spatial cognition, I stumbled upon an interesting notion: the development of an innate sense of direction may be significantly influenced during childhood through autonomous exploration. It’s a fascinating prospect—giving children the lead in navigation not only encourages a sense of independence but could be key in honing their innate navigational skills.\nResearch underscores the importance of early experiences in spatial awareness. Just like plants reaching out for sunlight, children seem to stretch their cognitive capabilities when allowed to navigate their environment. It’s this ‘learning by doing’ approach that can turn an ordinary walk into a developmental expedition. By simply allowing a child to lead the way—deciding when to turn left or right, or which path to take at a fork—we equip them with a compass of confidence that extends far beyond the physical realm.\nA study that resonates with me involves a two-week intervention designed to enhance body representation and motor skills among young children. This programme, engineered for kindergartners, wasn’t conducted in a controlled lab setting but rather in the dynamic classroom environment by their own teachers. The simplicity and directness of this method speak to me profoundly. It’s a testament to the power of integrating learning into daily activities and the remarkable plasticity of young minds.\nPersonal Reflections on Learning Autonomy\nIn my view, the philosophy of ‘guided freedom’ can be transformative. I’ve always believed that by giving children the reins within a safe and supervised setting, we encourage them to engage with their surroundings more meaningfully. When they’re in charge of finding their way—even in small measures—it’s not just a direction they’re discovering; it’s confidence, decision-making, and a sense of agency.\nThis approach mirrors my perspective on health and personal development: the path to growth is often self-directed, with the individual learning to navigate through choices and consequences. Whether it’s the neural pathways in our brains or the physical paths we walk, the journey towards mastery begins with steps taken independently, steps that teach us not just to follow directions, but to discern our own left from right.\n\nRead more at: Why some people can’t tell left from right - BBC Future\nYou may also be interested in: The Emotional Landscape of Feeding Kids- It Takes a Village"},"Notes/Four-Factors-of-Fitforlife":{"title":"Four Factors of Fitforlife","links":["Notes/Five-Essential-Movements","Notes/Dan-John's-Intervention","What-feels-good-q","Notes/Developing-a-vocabulary-for-Body-Awareness","Understanding-Pain"],"tags":[],"content":"Four Fitforlife Factors §\nPhysical Freedom\n\nFive Essential Movements by Dan John’s Intervention\nWhat feels good? / Developing a vocabulary for Body Awareness\nUnderstanding Pain\n\nEmotional Awareness\n\nWhat is my relationship to the activity\nI find it enjoyable.\nIt feels like a chore\n\nEnvironmental Awareness\n\nWhat factors make it easier or harder\n\nSocial Awareness\n\nWho helps me?\nWho holds me back?\n"},"Notes/Four-Factors-of-Flow":{"title":"Four Factors of Flow","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/flow","Notes/Direction-(re-Flow)","Notes/Attention-(re-Flow)","Notes/Enthusiasm-(re-Flow)","Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)","Extras/Images/stay-on-target.jpg","Poor-Diet"],"tags":["flow"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#flow\nFour Factors of Flow §\nThese are the four factors that govern flow. If you’re in Flow, it’s because these factors are doing well. If you are not in flow, then at least one factor isn’t doing well.\n\nMain Factors Governing the Strength of Each §\n\nDirection (re Flow) — Level of Clarity; Amount of Directions — Aside from “Nature &amp; Nurture” (which is a philosophical rabbit hole), it’s the Level of Clarity and Amount of Directions (i.e. the number of goals one has) that most govern the strength of Direction.\nAttention (re Flow) — Distractions in both Frequency and Intensity — This is most governed by Distractions: the Intensity of Distractions and the Frequency of Distractions.\nEnthusiasm (re Flow) — Level of Desire — This also ties into “Nature &amp; Nurture” a bit. It might sound circular, but one’s Level of Desire dictates one’s Enthusiasm. It’s the most intangible. What excites somebody? What inspires them, motivates them, fills them with passion? I’m not sure how to best affect one’s Enthusiasm. It’s the “Why” in the world of “Goal Setting.” It’s very personal to each person, but some commonalities are usually: to be stimulated and engaged, to feel important, to feel the work is important, to improve one’s financial situation.\nEnergy (re Flow) — Quality of Sleep, Diet, &amp; Exercise; Quality of Relationships &amp; Community; Quality of Leisure Time — also Hydration, Sunlight, Nature, Hobbies, etc.\n\nHow They Impact Each Other §\n\nIf Direction is clear and not diluted, then it’s easier to focus one’s Attention; Enthusiasm isn’t diluted; Energy isn’t wasted.\nIf Attention isn’t spread too thin amid myriad distractions, then it’s easier to stay on target in the ideal Direction; Enthusiasm isn’t diluted; Energy isn’t wasted.\nIf Enthusiasm is strong, then it’s easier to stay committed to one’s Direction; it’s easier to maintain one’s Attention; it’s easier to compensate for middling Energy levels.\nIf Energy is cultivated, then your Direction seems possible/doable/easier; You can more easily maintain your Attention; you can get work done even when you’re not feeling Enthusiasm (and through the process of doing the work, you can usually create new Enthusiasm).\n\nIf you have a Poor Diet (not included in the LYT Kit), then your Attention is going to suck: you’ll be more easily distracted; so you’ll spend time in other Directions; and thus you’ll dilute and dissipate your Enthusiasm. This one is a huge component that you can control. You can replace “Poor Diet” with “Lack of Sleep” and you’ll get similar results.\n\n\n"},"Notes/Four-Great-Chinese-Novels":{"title":"Four Great Chinese Novels","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nThe four great Chinese novels are:\n\nMonkey King (Journey to the West) by Wu Cheng’en\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong\nWater Margin by Shi Nai’an\nDream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin\n\nSee also §"},"Notes/Four-preferences-when-doing-business":{"title":"Four preferences when doing business","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Four preferences when doing business §\nVisual\nEmotional\nFunctional\nFinancial\nSource\nE-myth business"},"Notes/Foxes-and-hedgehogs-(analogy)":{"title":"Foxes and hedgehogs (analogy)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Foxes and hedgehogs (analogy) §\nQuote Greek poet Archilochus\nThe fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing\nHeck if I know what this means\nBut neither is good or bad.\nThey just have specific skills"},"Notes/Frame-of-Reference-(concept)":{"title":"Frame of Reference (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Frame of Reference (concept) §\nIn Physics, this is all about having a clear sense of what you’re basing things on.\n(Physics but also in humanities)\nIt’s this idea of you see based on where you are."},"Notes/Framing-by-Dysfunctional-belief":{"title":"Framing by Dysfunctional belief","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Framing by Dysfunctional belief §\nContext §\nIn the book desingning your life.\nThey tell a story\nand then talk about how that anecdote\nmanifests a dysfunctional belief\nthat is hurting us\nIn Psychology? §\nIs this just called reframing?\nWhat’s a good way to talk about this?\nTo show what it is"},"Notes/Framing":{"title":"Framing","links":["Notes/Priming","tags/concept"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"X:: Priming\ntags::#concept\nFraming §\nI’m the hidden 500 pound gorilla that underpins all human communication.\nIf you hear, “this doesn’t cost 1000,itonlycosts50!” That sounds great because it’s been framed in context to 1000.Buteven50 is a lot for a cup of coffee.\nThis is related to “moving the goalposts” and other cognitive biases (not included in the LYT Kit)\nWiki §\nThe Framing Effect: People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.

It can feel like something that is completely out of your control, and that can be frustrating and overwhelming.\nResearch has shown that certain genes can make some people more susceptible to chronic pain, which can make it a more persistent and severe problem for them. However, it’s important to note that while these genetic predispositions may play a role in chronic pain, they do not necessarily determine whether or not a person will experience it.\nAdditionally, it’s worth mentioning that while researchers have been able to identify genes that predispose people to chronic pain, they have not yet found any genes that increase the risk for acute back pain.\nThis suggests that the causes of acute back pain may be different from those of chronic pain and may be related more to lifestyle and environmental factors.\nThat’s interesting because chronic pain is so misunderstood and it’s hard to decide the best way to navigate it\nThat reminds me that I can’t always control everything. If I’m predisposed to chronic pain I have to accept that part of it.

It’s a conceptual marketplace, much like Socrates once wandered, where each absence is a fortune untold, each desire unformed a silent victory. I walk through my own marketplace, marveling not at the goods I pass by, but at the peaceful weightlessness of my own restraint.\nThis realization is liberating: recognizing that much of our satisfaction comes from the absence of burden, the nonexistence of hassle. In this uncluttered space, I find gratitude for the complexities I don’t shoulder, the problems I don’t endure. It’s a reminder that sometimes, happiness is found not in accumulation but in the serene landscape of simplicity.\nHere, I honor the wisdom of ancients, like Socrates, who found richness in the lack, who saw the marketplace’s abundance and felt wealth in necessity’s scarcity. “Look at all these things I don’t need,” he proclaimed, and so do I echo, finding abundance in the simplicity of life’s uncluttered canvas.\n\nRead more at: Happiness is a 2x2 Matrix - by David Epstein - Range Widely\nYou may also be interested in: The Gap Between Reality and Possibility"},"Notes/Gravity-Problems-(concepts)":{"title":"Gravity Problems (concepts)","links":["Notes/Gravity-problems-are-things-that-are-outside-of-your-control."],"tags":[],"content":"You can’t fight reality §\nThese are Gravity Problems §\nGravity problems are things that are outside of your control.\nAnalogy / Story §\nIn the book Designing your life\nThe others tell a funny hypothetical anecdote about a person complaining about gravity.\nThis person sits down with their friend at coffee.\nAnd then says.\n“I don’t know what to do about gravity”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I mean it’s everywhere and it’s taking over my life”\n“Every time I climb stairs or bike up a hill, I can feel it weighing me down”\n“…Umm”\nConcept §\nThe example is meant to be silly on purpose.\nIt doesn’t make sense to complain about gravity.\nBecause unless you can escape earth, and live on the moon or on mars.\nThen you’re never going to get away from the gravity ‘problem’\nIt’s an example of something that is 100% completely out of your control\nAnd it makes absolutely no sense to complain about something like that.\nYou should be focusing instead of things that are in your control.\nI cannot get ride of gravity but I can buy a lighter backpack\nThat kind of framing\nExamples §\nIt’s in the anonymous programs.\nThe whole wisdom there is that there are things that are outside of our control.\nThe stoics too touch on this idea.\nBut it applies to everyone\nand it applies to fitness also.\nIn fitness §\nYou’ll find that as you look around you, there will be things that you can control and things that you cannot control.\nI cannot (easily) control, where I live and who I live with\nMaybe those things I can try to change down the line.\nBut not quickly and not easily\nI can never control\nmy genetics\nthe way my body is going to react to certain stimuli\nmy brain\nthings that neuroscience knows to be true\nand that I cannot imagine myself to be the exception to\nI can more easily control\nwhat are these things?\nMaybe your diet?\nMaybe the way you spend your time?\nMaybe the people you spend time with?\nMaybe what’s in your immediate environment\nSummarize §\nBeing able to distinguish between these things is 80% of the battle\nIf you are trying to control something that you cannot\nThen you’re wasting 100% of your effort\nIf you’re trying to control something that is hard to control\nIt’s doable, but man it’s a lot of work\nand it’s not a very efficient approach\nIt often leaves you feeling tired, stressed, frustrated\nBut if you focus on the things that are in your control.

The idea is to continually increase the amount of weight or resistance to stimulate muscle growth or strength gains. But what if we flip the script? Enter “Greasing the Groove,” a strategy that focuses on volume through sub-maximal sets.\nThe beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and adaptability. Instead of pushing for the hardest possible reps each time, you focus on quality reps that are less taxing. This allows for more sets and, consequently, a higher total volume of work. It’s akin to a writer focusing on writing 200 good words every day rather than aiming for a perfect essay in one sitting. Over time, those 200 words add up to a substantial body of work.\nFor someone like me, who finds most exercise routines boring, this approach can be a game-changer. It allows for more frequent engagement with the activity, making it easier to integrate into daily life. It’s not about the grand gestures of lifting the heaviest weight; it’s about the consistent, smaller actions that accumulate into significant results.\nHowever, it’s crucial to remember that “Greasing the Groove” is not a one-size-fits-all strategy.

Then, when we repeat that same action, it  miraculously requires less effort. How can this be?!\nIt’s because Nature’s Selfish Gene has a prime directive to survive—which means to become more efficient—so whatever you do once, is easier to do a second time.\nBy making a repeated action more efficient, less energy is used, less willpower is required1, and fewer calories are burned—all of which lead to a better chance of survival.\nBad habits and good habits are nothing more than a bunch of self-perpetuating Feedback Loops that have grown efficient over time, with deeply enmeshed neural connections. In this way, “Passing mental states become lasting neural traits”.2\nTo quit a bad habit, don’t try to stop it like Superman; you’ll fail. Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia in the form of built-up neural efficiencies in the brain (see Cobwebs into Cables). Instead, try to co-opt it by shifting the tracks. See Changing a habit is really about replacing a routine.\n\nWhile “habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage”, it doesn’t necessarily form in the ways you might think—meaning, your “self” optimizes for what you repeat, regardless of whether or not it’s “good” for you.\nTransclude of block 309fcc\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2020-05-29\ncreated:: 2020-05-29\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes §\n\n\nWhen it comes to willpower expenditure, the anterior cingulate cortex, is a crucial player. ↩\n\n\nQuote by Hebb’s Rule ↩\n\n\n"},"Notes/Habits-are-all-about-identity-change":{"title":"Habits are all about identity change","links":["Atomic-Habits","James-Clear"],"tags":[],"content":"Habits are all about Identity Change §\nSource §\n\nAtomic Habits by James Clear\n\nKey idea §\n\nIdentity change: It’s not about how or what\n\nIt’s all about who\n\n\n\nYou become your habits\nThis is very\nVirtue ethics\nAristotle"},"Notes/Habits-carry-a-ton-of-hidden-inertia":{"title":" Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia ","links":["Notes/Feedback-Loop","Flywheel-Effect","Frankenstein-Monster","Pace-Layers","Notes/Like-begets-like","Maps/Habits-MOC"],"tags":["-habit-"],"content":"While some Feedback Loops show immediate results, many times progress is hidden until much further along in time.

The law posits two routes to conquering inertia: either make the pain of inaction greater than the pain of action, or make the pleasure of action surpass the pleasure of inaction.\nIn the context of health, this is a game-changer. We often think of motivation as an internal force, something we either have or don’t. But what if we could externalize it? What if we could design our environment in such a way that it nudges us toward the behaviors we desire?\nConsider the gym-goer who places their workout clothes next to their bed the night before. This simple act reduces the friction of getting started, making the “pain of action” less daunting. On the flip side, imagine filling your home with only healthy snacks. The “pleasure of action” (eating well) suddenly becomes easier to achieve than the “pleasure of inaction” (indulging in junk food).\nBut here’s where it gets personal for me: I’ve always found most exercise to be dreadfully boring. So, I’ve had to get creative with my environment to make the “pleasure of action” outweigh the “pleasure of inaction.” For instance, I’ve combined workouts with activities I enjoy, like listening to podcasts or audiobooks. This way, the pleasure of action isn’t just about the exercise; it’s about the entire experience.\nThe key takeaway? Don’t underestimate the power of your environment. It’s not just about willpower; it’s about setting up your surroundings to make the right choices the easy ones.

The narrative isn’t merely about isolated acts of individual genius but rather a testament to the power of a conducive environment. A nurturing atmosphere can serve as a petri dish for creative endeavors, often more so than the relentless pursuit of effort alone.\nWhen I reflect on this, I’m reminded that as a coach, creating a fertile ground for ideas and innovation should be as intentional as fostering discipline. The Swedish music marvel wasn’t a blueprint design but rather a happy coincidence that underscores the importance of a rich soil where creativity can spontaneously sprout.\nIn a sense, every creator or mentor is an urban planner for the mind’s metropolis. Ensuring there are parks and plazas where ideas can meander and mingle is as critical as constructing the rigid schedules that are the skyscrapers of productivity.\nThis perspective shifts the spotlight from the romance of the lone creator to the collective symphony of a scene. It implies that perhaps our individual efforts are but single instruments playing in a grander orchestra, modulated by the acoustics of our surroundings.\nAnd so, the Swedish model becomes a blueprint for intentional scene creation, not just in music, but in any creative venture.

But if you zoom out, and view your goals from a big picture, you can see how your goals connect to one another.\nImagine 3 levels of Goals: The Super-goal, the Intermediate-Goal, the Sub-Goal §\nOur goals fall into one of these 3:\n\nIf the super goal is “I want to be healthy”\nThe intermediate goals are “To be physically strong,” “To avoid stress,” and “To eat well”\nThen sub-goals are “Exercise 15 minutes a day,” “Eat a handful of greens at dinner,” AKA your smart goals\n\nSee how your goals connect and expect it to be non-linear! §\nThat’s because a sub-goal can link to more than 1 intermediate goal. And an intermediate goal can link to more than 1 super goal.\nBecause health is interconnected, you can expect one practice to benefit the others also. It’s not a simple IF-THIS-THEN-THAT. You can experience benefits in many areas at once with health practices.\nAnd it helps to see it all laid out.\nSeeing the network shows you different paths to work on your health §\nWith your Goal Network, even when motivation is low, you can stay on track.\nBecause many Sub-Goals can get you to your Super-Goal. This lets you be flexible, and it helps you keep your long term big goals in mind all the time.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\n[202203212027- Motivation For lifelong goals](202203212027-%20Motivation%20For%20lifelong%20goals.md)\n[202204110953 - The real reason people don&#039;t really get started](202204110953%20-%20The%20real%20reason%20people%20don&#039;t%20really%20get%20started.md)\n\nSource §"},"Notes/Health-and-Wealth":{"title":"Health and Wealth","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202111281850- Health and Wealth\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThe common factor between growing wealth and practicing health §\nThis week is one my own writing.\nSomeone shared with me a podcast with Morgan Housel, the author of The Psychology of Money. I couldn’t help but see the parallels between building health and developing the mindset for lifelong health.\nI wrote this Twitter post on how this applies to ex-athletes. And the response was very positive from a lot of other people too.\nSo here’s a more generalized version of the ideas I wrote about.\n#1 We overlook the benefits of the compounding effect §\nThe classic story here is the one of the chessboard and the doubling grain of rice. I’ve heard this many times. I studied Mathematics in college. I know it’s true, and it still feels counterintuitive. \nI think the paradigm shift here is not thinking of it in terms of losses or gains, but in terms of making your base bigger. If you make your goal a 1% increase, that feels like very little. (see also: James Clear on 1% better). But the trick is in how much you start with.\nIf you start at 10, 1% of that is 1,\nbut 1% of 100 is 10,\n1% of 1000 is 100…\nYou get the idea.\nIf you’re starting out at 1, that’s great. Gain 1% slowly and steadily, and before you know it, you’re working with such a big base that health growth becomes easier and steadier.\n#2 We compare ourselves to others too much §\nI’m guilty of this myself.\nAs an ex-athlete, I’m always trying to compete with other people. We see other people who look further along than us, and it feels discouraging. We don’t even want to start our own journeys.\nMorgan Housel writes about Internal and External Benchmarks. \nIf you’re measuring yourself against other people (External Benchmarks) you’ll always find someone who seems more healthier, stronger, and further along their health journey.\nInstead focus on Internal Benchmarks. Understand what your values are, and what makes you happy. That can be the measure of your progress\n#3 Avoid extremes and seek balance §\nIn order the get the benefits of the compounding effect, you have to be consistent.\nWe have this tendency to be all or nothing. We set big goals, push hard for a while and then stop abandon them when things get hard.\nInstead, plan around the highs and lows. When things are good, take advantage, and brace yourself for challenging times. When things are challenging, do the minimums, get through, and be ready for when things lighten up.\nThe trick is to be consistent, and never hit pause on your practices.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/Health-coaching-2.0":{"title":"Health coaching 2.0","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Health coaching 2.0\nHabits lifestyles and systems"},"Notes/Health-from-and-health-for":{"title":"Health from and health for","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/on/freedom","tags/health","tags/on/healthy-mindsets","Notes/Unlikely-Health-App"],"tags":["permanent-note","on/freedom","health","on/healthy-mindsets"],"content":"topic: 202201091015- Health from and health for\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#on/freedom#health#on/healthy-mindsets\nurl: §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nWhen I look at all the different approaches to health, I notice you can divide them into 2 different categories: Health From and Health for\nHealth From is when people aim to be healthy because they’re afraid\nThey’re afraid of getting sick\nThey’re afraid of looking unattractive\nThey’re afraid of death\nThey’re afraid of being weak\nAnd that’s fine, but it’s completely different from Health For\nWhat is ‘Health For’?\nIt’s when you choose to be healthy not because you’re trying to avoid something.

I started at border of France and Spain, and just starting walking. I walked 30km a day. I walked through rain. I walked in sun. I wanted to prove to myself that I would be able to finish the challenge.\nIn the end, the 1000km didn’t matter at all.\nAt the end, I felt healthy because I had never been happier §\nI lost 10kg by the end of my walk.\nI started at 72kg and dropped down to 62kg. But I didn’t care. I had walked 1000km. But it didn’t matter. I just felt so completely happy to have walked for 40 days. I could’ve done half of that and still felt just as great. I met fantastic people who walked with me. I was the happiest I had even been\nThat was when I clearly saw how happiness comes before health, not the other way around.\nBy plunging into my being- instead of my goals- I found health §\nI don’t like to walk- “I am a walker”\nWalking is who I am. Turns out I’m just as happy walking 1km in 10 minutes as I am walking 1000km in 40 days. The distance doesn’t matter and the goal is just a number. The trap people fall into is: When I reach my health goals, then I’ll be happy.\nBut what I learned is that by focusing my identity, I get to be happy, and then health follows.\nYour health is a practice not a product §\nThe trap is that you’ll always be looking for the next thing to make you healthy:\nBut that’s a bottomless pit:\n\n“What is the next peak I can hit?”\n“How can I keep optimizing for health?”\n“What new gadget can change the game for me?”\n\nShift to identity.

Stare at the weight gains and remind yourself of what you did on those days because you tracked it. Do not stop tracking, as the habit of tracking is the key to success. The goal is to track, not just to lose weight. Because if the goal is to lose weight, it can be hard to be perfectly linear, but if the goal is to track, then you’re making progress no matter what. Step on the scale every day and own it.\nThat’s interesting because you have to measure something. And though people say you shouldn’t just rely on the scale, if your weight is the metric you care about (for now) then you should 100% track it\nThat reminds me of the quote, “what is not measured is not managed” it’s almost important to balance these things.\nIt’s similar because if we want to make progress we do need some real numbers there to really put it into perspecdtive\nIt’s different because sometimes, we can get caught up in the measuring.

PAGASA notes that when the wind shifts from northeasterly to easterly, that’s when the monsoon ends.\nYou can think of our climate as having two seasons— the rainy and the dry. The rainy is from June to November. The dry actually can be divided into two seasons pala. There’s a cool dry from December to February, then there’s a hot dry from March to May.\nThe Northeast Monsoon is also called the AMIHAN. This is cold winds from the northeast that brings rain over the eastern side. The Southwest Monsoon naman is the HABAGAY is the warm moist winds from the southwest. This one affects Laguna (and the western parts of the Philippines)\nSome observations §\nI’m noticing a lot things are coming to life in June\nas the rainy season is about to start\nso it does feel like this is where things start to come alive.\nWhy is it important? §\nI guess this is kinda obvious.\nBut to me it was not.\nI’ve had to learn this through experience.\nIt’s important though because it affects what I can grow and when I can grow them.\nSource:\nhttp://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/information/climate-philippines"},"Notes/Houseplants-as-Natural-Disinfectants":{"title":"Houseplants as Natural Disinfectants","links":["Notes/Monotropa-plants"],"tags":["air-quality","air","natural","health","houseplants","virus"],"content":"Stumbling upon the article “Having Plants Can Help Prevent Colds,” I’ve gleaned a piece of wisdom that feels almost serendipitous. It turns out, the very plants that quietly bask in our living spaces serve as silent sentinels against viruses. Through photosynthesis, they produce hydrogen peroxide—the same antiseptic we’ve all used on cuts—which then mingles with the air, deactivating viruses in our midst.\nIt’s a revelation, really; the same substance dabbed on scraped knees is being conjured by our leafy companions, purifying the air we breathe. This intertwining of plant life and human health underscores a broader symbiosis that often goes unnoticed. Our indoor foliage isn’t just a static decor; it’s an active participant in our well-being, an ally tucked in plain sight, safeguarding our homes.\nIt makes me ponder, what else do these quiet cohabitants do for us that we have yet to uncover? The beauty of nature’s complexity is that it often gifts us with such elegantly simple solutions—houseplants as a defense strategy is a testament to that.\n\nRead more at: Medscape Registration\nYou may also be interested in: Monotropa plants"},"Notes/How-Aging-Affects-Dehydration":{"title":"How Aging Affects Dehydration","links":["Nutrition-MOC","Notes/Food-is-your-best-medicine-by-Eugene-Schwartz"],"tags":["hydration","aging","water","body-function"],"content":"While there’s little we can do about losing the ability to concentrate urine, we can be more deliberate in our fluid intake as a means of maintaining adequate hydration.\n\nRead more at: How does aging increase risk of dehydration?\nGo one level up : Nutrition MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Food is your best medicine by Eugene Schwartz"},"Notes/How-Atomic-Habits-fit-into-the-conversation-on-habits":{"title":"How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","tags/on/pd","2018---Atomic-Habits-(book)","Notes/Trust-the-process-(kit)","Notes/Understanding-the-habit-cycle-and-habitual-cues","Notes/Charting-out-habit-cycles-in-my-life-circa-2013","Notes/Flow","Our-brain's-attentional-filter-responds-to-Importance-and-Novelty"],"tags":["habit","on/pd"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit,#on/pd\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nSome content and links have been removed.\n\n\nHow Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits §\nAtomic Habits is a term from James Clear, with a book of the same name.\nHere’s a summary of his argument:\n\nWinners and losers can have the same goals, so what actually makes the difference? The system and process. Yep, makes me this of my ode to The Process, see Trust the process (kit).\nHabits are the fundamental unit of your systems. Your current systems are perfectly designed to provide you with your current results.\n\nJames adds a fourth step to Duhigg’s habit cycle, which was needed. James is a smart dude. Check out the steps here: Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues.\nOther tidbits:\n\nThe first step is Awareness. Discover and record your habits throughout the day. Here’s an example of me Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013\n\nThe more specific the implementation, the more motivation, ie time, place, etc\n\n\nFocus on Identity over Outcome: ie “I’m the guy who…” over thinking about the result I want…Every action you take is you casting a vote for your identity.\nJames shares ‘The Goldilocks rule’, which is nothing more than finding Flow through balancing challenge with ability, which apparently is 3-4% beyond your current ability. You need victories to stay satisfied, but you need to be challenged.\n\n\n“Men desire novelty to such a degree that men who are doing well require it just as much as men who are not.”\n\nAh yes, “novelty”. Reminds me of how Our brain’s attentional filter responds to Importance and Novelty.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2019-10-01\ncreated:: 2019-10-01\nmodified:: 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/How-Crossfit-Acts-Like-a-Religion":{"title":" How Crossfit Acts Like a Religion ","links":["Notes/Find-a-group-where-your-desired-culture-exists","Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/Health,-Culture,-and-National-security"],"tags":["-health-","-community-"],"content":"The rise of CrossFit as a non-religious community functioning in ways that resemble religion is a fascinating phenomenon that reflects broader societal trends.\nWith the decline of traditional religious institutions and the increasing number of people identifying as religiously unaffiliated, many people are seeking out alternative communities to fill the void left by the decline of organized religion.\nCrossFit provides a sense of community, shared values, and rituals that are reminiscent of religious practices. These activities create a sense of belonging and shared purpose, much like what one might find in a religious community.\nHowever, there are also concerns about the ways in which these non-religious communities can function in ways that are exclusive or harmful.\nCrossFit, for example, has been criticized for promoting an unhealthy and dangerous culture of extreme exercise and body shaming.\nAdditionally, the sense of community and shared purpose that these communities provide can also lead to insularity and the exclusion of outsiders.\nAs society continues to change and evolve, it is important to consider the ways in which non-religious communities can function in positive and negative ways, and to work towards creating inclusive and welcoming spaces for all individuals.\nThat’s interesting because if we care about getting people healthy, thinking about it from a structural and societal level is where we can make really big impacts.\nWill power is way overrated, and designing your environment is 10x more effective.\nThat reminds me of Find a group where your desired culture exists.\nIt’s similar because if you want to make some kind of positive (or negative) change in yourself, then surround yourself with a group where that behavior is already manifested. That’s the idea behind things like AA or the 12 step programs.\nYou acquire the beliefs, behaviors, and cultural norms through osmosis\nBut there’s always a danger of cult-like or fanatic attitudes. The question is how to harness it properly and fully and effective.\nIt’s important because if we want people to be healthy, we definitely need to resolve this question.\n\nRead more at: How CrossFit Acts Like a Religion - The Atlantic\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Health, Culture, and National security"},"Notes/How-F1-does-the-behind-the-scenes-and-builds-an-audience":{"title":"How F1 does the behind the scenes and builds an audience","links":["Notes/Reputation-is-a-long-game-build-it-slowly","Notes/Deploy-Empathy-+-Kevon's-Be-a-Dummy"],"tags":["-behind-the-scenes-on/build-in-public-drive-to-survive-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nHow “Not” to Market Your Sport\nurl: https://thedigitalauthentic.substack.com/p/how-not-to-market-your-sport\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nOccasionally, team principals and race engineers will talk live with the broadcast crew, giving fans a behind the scenes look at the strategy employed during the race.\nThe success of Netflix’s Drive to Survive shows the power of behind the scenes\nSee also §\nReputation is a long game build it slowly\nDeploy Empathy + Kevon’s Be a Dummy"},"Notes/How-Gen-Z-will-Reshape-Fitness":{"title":"How Gen Z will Reshape Fitness","links":["Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/How-I-would-change-youth-physical-education"],"tags":["gen-z","kids","youth","fitness"],"content":"Youth movement.\nAs we detailed in Issue No. 240 , Gen Z might reshape fitness — and the effects are already being felt.

According to Wapnick, people who lean more toward multipotentiality crave three things from their career and life: variety, meaning, and money. To help multipotentialites find the right path, Wapnick has outlined four ways to find jobs that can help you achieve this.\nThe first is the “Group hug” approach, which involves having one job that lets you do many different things you are interested in.\nThe second is the “Slash approach,” where you combine two or more part-time jobs, often in fairly niche careers.\nThe third is the “Einstein approach,” where you find a job that you don’t mind doing to pay the bills, but which also leaves you enough time and energy to pursue other passions on the side.\nThe last approach is the “Phoenix approach,” where you pursue one job or career trajectory with a healthy dose of obsession for a while, then quit and start over in another field.\nBy considering these approaches, multipotentialites can find a career or life trajectory that brings them fulfillment, variety, meaning, and money.\nThat’s interesting because I have always identified as someone who is incredibly multidisciplinary. But I’ve struggled to turn that into a career\nThat reminds me of David Epstein’s book Range- a simple book with a pretty good concept.\nIt’s similar because the belief is that people who specialize are the ones who advance. But the truth is that people who are multidisciplinary are the most innovative and the most useful indviduals\nSee also Being multi disciplinary and multi sport\nIt’s different because it just feels very different than what the culture values\nIt’s important because if we are going to educate kids on how to do well in society.

That is keeping you from being active or doing the things you want to do.\nI know how frustrating and debilitating this can be. I’ve been there myself. But I’m here to tell you that you can do something about it.\nThere are ways to get relief from your pain and get your life back. I’m not going to promise you that it will be easy. But I can promise you that it will be worth it.\nAnd while we can’t make it better 5 videos, we can begin a journey to think about what getting better looks like.\nI’m here to help you every step of the way. So please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n—-\nI want to start by saying that you have the amazing ability to recover. \nIt may seem hard to believe right now. But the body’s ability to recover is already a part of you. It is wired in your DNA. We evolved to recover from injuries. This is necessary if we were to survive.\nYou might ask, so what happened? \nWhy does it still feel injured even though my body has this ability to bounce back? \nHow did I get stuck?\nAnd while this is not a simple question to answer, let’s start by looking at one place - the mind.\n—-\nWhenever we experience pain, get hurt or injured. Our brain remembers that pain and where it came from- and it does it to protect you!\nThis is useful, and good for you. \nEspecially if you think about our early ancestors and how they had to make sense of the world.\nIf you’re out in the jungle hunting for wild animals, and you touch some poison ivy and it becomes itchy and painful. \nThe memory of that pain is there to make sure that you never touch it again! Your mind will remember that pain so that you don’t make that mistake again.\n–\nThe same thing happens when you injure your body.\nImagine that you’re going for a run, and your ankle starts feeling  painful. You get it checked, and the doctor tells you it’s a sprain. He gives you some medicine, and tells you to rest and stretch it for 2 weeks. \nWhen your body recovers, your mind still remembers- \n“Oh when I did that run, I hurt my ankle- so I should avoid running because it’s dangerous.”\nThat’s your mind trying to protect you!\nThe problem comes in when our bodies have , but our mind is still in pain and high alert mode\nWe want to find that sweet spot for you. \nBecause too much fear, too much worry can keep you from doing anything. After all, one way to never get injured is to sit on the couch and never move again! But that’s not what you want.\nSo you don’t want to suppress your fear, go out and be completely reckless. That’s not the right way to go about it also.\nYou have to find that goldilocks area- and to do that you need to deal with the fear in your mind.\n–\nAnd the first thing I want to dispel from your fear is that your body is beyond repair\nWe still have this old idea that movement and our bodies are like cars and machines. That if there is pain it’s because something is out of alignment or something is out of place. \nThen we end up believing that if there’s  pain that won’t go away, then something must be out of place in my body.\nBut that is an outdated model and is too simple.\nIt’s funny to say, but remember your body is a living, breathing, adapting, and growing thing. You are not some car that gets more and more broken down as time passes.\nYour body is adaptable. It can change and adjust depending on all sorts of situations that you experience.\n– \nAnd when you look at the human body and how it has evolved, it is clear that we were meant to move. \nWe have long legs and arms that are perfect for walking and running. We also have strong muscles that allow us to carry heavy objects. \nFor millions of years, we were hunter-gatherers who walked long distances and carried things to find food and shelter.\nBut today, most of us live very different lives. We don’t have to walk long distances to find food. And we don’t have to carry heavy loads. Instead, we sit in cars and offices all day. We don’t use our muscles very much and we don’t get the chance to move around a lot.\nSo, it’s important to remember what our bodies evolved to do. \nTrust me, you’re not going to undo thousands of years of evolution by getting injured that one time\nYour body can bounce back- and you have to bring your mind into that journey also\n–\nThe second thing to dispel is the belief that you’ve made irreversible damage to your body.\nMost people believe that once they injure their body, it’s irreversible. They think it will never be 100% again.\nBut the truth is, most injuries recover well. And our bodies adapt to the injuries that take place. \nYes, there are some serious injuries that are the exception. But for the most part, I’d say 99% of injuries recover well.\nI see this the most with food and diet. You believe that if you’ve been eating unhealthy foods for years, you’ll never be 100% healthy. But the truth is, regular healthy eating can reverse most of that.\nIf you’ve been living a sedentary lifestyle for many years, a few months of exercise will reverse a lot of that. \nSo, if you’re worried that you’ve gone too far, don’t be. You can always make changes to get your body back on track.\n–\nThe third fear that I want to dispel is that it’s too late to get back into action for me.\nDoes it feel like you’ve been meaning to get better, but then you put it off. Until you feel so far behind that you can’t catch up.\nYou’re not alone, many people feel this way. I have been there myself also.\nIt is easy to get stuck in thinking about how great my body used to be before I got injured. And it takes some mental work to move past that and start looking forward to how your body can be in the future.\nAnd to do that, you have to dispel the believe that it’s too let to get back. There are plenty of people who put of recovery, started late, but are now moving well and worry-free.\nSo, if you’re feeling like it’s too late for you to recover, don’t worry. It’s never too late to start working on it.\n–\nFinally, I want to add that getting back from injury is 20% inspiration and 80% practice. \nI hope with this series, you get that inspiration you need to trust your body again\nAnd then I hope you find ways to put that inspiration into practice\n**"},"Notes/How-people-use-F.U.D.-to-trap-you-(concept)":{"title":"How people use F.U.D. to trap you (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How people use F.U.D. to trap you (concept) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Ideas §\n\n\nFear, uncertainty, doubt\n\n\nThese are big ones in the industry, that they use to manipulate you\n\n\nImplicitly, it says I am the only one you can trust\n\n\nSo a salesperson will try to set up themselves as the only one with answers\n\n"},"Notes/How-religion-failed-to-compete":{"title":"How religion failed to compete","links":["Notes/Why-philosophy-is-better-than-science","Notes/Science-can-be-just-as-cherry-picky-as-religion"],"tags":["-on/religion-catholicism-authority-on/epistemology-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nreligion, via interdicts, allows the intergenerational transmission of survival heuristics and is effective in nudging people into some classes of behavior[16].\nEffectively, Catholicism lost its moral authority the minute it mixed epistemic and pisteic belief –breaking the link between holy and the profane.

This is misleading; it falsely implies that happiness comes in a one-size-fits-all package. The truth, as you’ve noticed, is more complex, resembling an intricate tapestry woven from multiple schools of thought, personal experiences, and cultural influences.\nHere are some thought-provoking inquiries for you:\n\nHave you been simply “inheriting” your ideas of happiness from your environment?\nAre there specific theories you’ve been unintentionally loyal to, which may not truly serve your unique well-being?\n\nThese questions make me think about how the concept of happiness is not an IKEA shelf, waiting to be assembled with an Allen wrench according to universal instructions. No, it’s more akin to creating your own sculpture, bit by bit, from an unshaped block of marble. You have the license to chisel away the extraneous, mix different artistic schools, and maybe even add splashes of color where they’re least expected.\nA journey into understanding multiple theories of happiness can equip you with a “toolbox” of sorts. This toolbox doesn’t necessarily dictate your happiness but allows for a nuanced understanding of it. The key is to not just adopt theories wholesale but to mix and match them in ways that resonate with you—after all, you’re the expert on your own well-being. By acknowledging the shades of gray, you grant yourself the freedom to fine-tune your personal happiness formula, instead of accepting some off-the-shelf solution.\nThis matters greatly in the broader scope of life satisfaction and well-being. Understanding that happiness isn’t a one-lane road but a sprawling, multi-dimensional landscape can empower you to be more compassionate towards others and their differing happiness theories. It also offers you the opportunity to update or replace any elements that aren’t serving you well, much like a software patch that fine-tunes a complex program.\nWhy not embark on an “happiness exploration,” just like one might hike through a foreign land, keeping the best finds and discarding the unhelpful, until you’ve created your custom guidebook for a fulfilling life?\n\nRead more at: Eleven theories for how to achieve true happiness\nGo one level up : Philosophy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Human Nature and The Happiness Lottery"},"Notes/How-to-Deal-with-Fads":{"title":"How to Deal with Fads","links":["Notes/Some-methods-today-will-seem-no-brute-force-in-the-future","Notes/The-End-of-History-Illusion"],"tags":[],"content":"How to Deal with Fads §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea §\n\nThere will always be new fads\nBut we’re always learning\n\nSee also §\n\n\nMakes me think of plagues\n\nand how we treat diseases\nSome methods today will seem no brute force in the future\n\n\n\nHow to Talk about fads\n\n\nThe End of History Illusion\n\n"},"Notes/How-to-Delegate-a-task":{"title":"How to Delegate a task","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://profitfactory.com/360delegation/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nReally great article\nVision\nResources\nDefinition of Done\nSee also §"},"Notes/How-to-Design-Behavior-by-BJ-Fogg":{"title":"How to Design Behavior by BJ Fogg","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How to Design Behavior by BJ Fogg §\nSource §\n\n\n\nKey Ideas §\n\nI really like the 2 maxims idea here\n"},"Notes/How-to-Engage-on-Twitter":{"title":"How to Engage on Twitter","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How to engage on Twitter §\nPlease remember that it’s not about being smart or clever\nIt’s always about providing value.\nSo when you tweet and reply\nBe smart and funny and kind.\nBe likeable"},"Notes/How-to-Get-Rich-by-Naval":{"title":"How to Get Rich by Naval","links":["Naval","tags/on/video"],"tags":["on/video"],"content":"\nAuthor: Naval\nFull Title: How to Get Rich\nUrl: https://youtu.be/1-TZqOsVCNM?t=9301\nCategory:#on/video\ntags:\n\n\nTitle §\n\nHighlights (with time stamps) §\n\n2:31\n\nAdvice are like anecdotes and maxims that I can recall\n\n\n3:13\n\nThe Schilling Point\n\n\n\nKey Ideas (to develop into individual notes) §"},"Notes/How-to-Get-Young-People-to-Stop-Smoking":{"title":"How to Get Young People to Stop Smoking","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","Notes/Bad-habits-are-autocatalytic"],"tags":["-smoking-","-health-","-habits-","-culture-"],"content":"I learned something interesting about smoking and why so few people now smoke.

It can be difficult to adjust to a new lifestyle and to cope with the physical and emotional challenges that come with it. A support group can provide a much-needed sense of community and can be a great source of advice and support.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, ask your doctor or rehabilitation team if they know of any support groups in your area. You can also search online for groups that focus on specific injuries or conditions.\n\nFind a coach or trainer who focuses on mindset\n\nMany times, working with a coach or trainer can help increase your confidence. They can help you set appropriate goals and give you the guidance and support you need to reach those goals.\nThis is something that is overlooked, because we see injury just as a physical issue. But if you’re struggling with confidence, you will benefit more from seeing a counselor or mindset coach who can help you work though negative thoughts and feelings.\nIf you’re dealing with an injury, it’s important to find a coach or trainer who understands your situation and can help you build confidence. They can help you set appropriate goals and give you the guidance and support you need to reach those goals.\nThis is something that is overlooked, because we see injury just as a physical issue. But if you’re struggling with confidence, you will benefit more from seeing a counselor or mindset coach who can help you work though negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nGet back to your sport or activity-\n\nWhen you’re injured, it’s easy to lose confidence. You may feel like you’re not good enough, or like you’ll never be able to do what you used to do.\nBut it’s important to remember that you can get better. And one of the best ways to do that is to get back to the sport or activity that you love as soon as you can. This is often the hardest step, but it’s also the most important. Getting back to the activity or sport that you love will help you to remember why you’re doing all of this in the first place. It will also help your body to continue to heal and to get stronger.\nOf course, you’ll need to be careful. Don’t push yourself too hard, and listen to your body. But if you can, getting back to the sport or activity that you love will help you on the road to recovery.\n\nCelebrate the wins, no matter how small\n\nI was in a car accident a few years ago that left me with some serious injuries. I was in a lot of pain and had to miss a lot of work. I was also really afraid that I would never be able to do the things I used to be able to do.I had to start my rehabilitation from scratch and it was a long and difficult journey. But, I am happy to say that I am now back to my old self and I am even better than before.\nOne of the things that helped me the most during my rehabilitation was celebrating the wins, no matter how small. Every time I was able to do something that I thought I wouldn’t be able to do, I would take a moment to celebrate.\nIt sounds like a small thing, but it made a big difference for me. It helped me to stay positive and motivated, and it also helped me to feel like I was making progress.\nIf you are currently injured, or if you have recently been injured, I encourage you to try celebrating the wins, no matter how small. It might just make a big difference for you too.\nYour mind is the number 1 killer of injury recovery. §\nIf you want to recover, you have to change your mindset. You have to start thinking positively. You have to start believing in yourself.\nIt’s not easy, but it’s so worth it.\nIf you need help, please reach out. There are so many people who want to help you. You are not alone."},"Notes/How-to-design-a-movement-puzzle-for-yourself":{"title":"How to design a movement puzzle for yourself","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202201132059- How to design a movement puzzle for yourself\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note\nurl: §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/How-to-develop-expert-level-Jedi-powers":{"title":"How to develop expert level Jedi powers","links":["Notes/Mindfully-watching-to-learn-(concept)","Notes/Using-the-best-focus-for-the-right-time"],"tags":["-instinct-","-performance-","-learning-","-attention-"],"content":"Cricket batters seem to have Jedi powers\nScience now tells us that elite batsmen aren’t much different: they know where the ball is going to be before it gets there and saccade their vision to that point.

But if the pain is severe or you’re having trouble using the injured body part, it’s probably time to seek medical attention.\n\nIs the pain getting worse?\n\nIf the pain from your injury is getting worse instead of better, it’s time to see a doctor.\n\nAre you having other symptoms?\n\nIf you’re injured and also experiencing other symptoms like fever, chills, or nausea, it’s a good idea to see a doctor. These could be signs of a more serious problem.\n\nIs the injury preventing you from doing your usual activities?\n\nIf you can’t do your usual activities because of your injury, it’s time to see a doctor.\n\nAre you worried about the injury?\n\nIf you’re feeling anxious or stressed about your injury, it’s a good idea to see a doctor. Worrying about an injury can make it harder to heal.\nIf you’re still not sure whether or not you should see a doctor, it’s always a good idea to err on the side of caution. You can always call your doctor’s office to ask for their opinion.\nIn general, it’s a good idea to see a doctor if you’re in pain, the pain is getting worse, you’re having other symptoms, or you’re worried about the injury.\nIt’s a good idea to see a doctor if you’re feeling anxious or stressed about your injury.

And it’s frustrating. And that’s not what you want to hear.\nBut that’s the truth. It’s not inevitable. You will get hurt at some point, and you will have pain.\nSo you’ll see a doctor and visit a physical therapist. Maybe 2 times a week. Maybe 3.\nBut they’ll all tell you the same thing\n“If you want to recover, you’re going to have to do these exercises at home.”\nAnd that’s the hardest part.\nAt the end of the day, you are responsible for being engaged in recovering from injury at home §\nResearch shows that only 35% of physical therapy patients fully adhere to their plans of care.1 That’s a staggeringly low number, and it turns out that most patients simply aren’t doing their prescribed physical therapy home exercise programs. The most common reasons cited are lack of motivation, questions regarding self-efficacy, and environmental blocks to movement.\nHow can you address the factors in the study?\nHow can I deal with lack of motivation? §\nOne of the best ways to overcome a lack of motivation is to have a plan.\nBefore you start your at-home exercises, sit down and map out exactly what you need to do and when you need to do it. This will help you stay on track and make sure that you’re doing everything you need to in order to recover.\nIt’s important to set realistic goals for your at-home exercise program. If you’re too ambitious, you’re likely to get discouraged and give up. On the other hand, if your goals are too easy, you won’t see the results you’re hoping for.\nConsider also getting a partner\nRecovering from an injury can be a lonely process, but it doesn’t have to be. Find a friend or family member who can help you with your at-home exercises. This will not only make the process more enjoyable, but it will also help you stay accountable.\nFinally take it one day at a time\nRecovering from an injury can be a long and difficult process. It’s important to take it one day at a time and not get too ahead of yourself. Set small goals and celebrate each and every accomplishment, no matter how small.\nHow can I feel sure that what I’m doing works? §\nFirst, it’s important to understand that your fear, worry, and anxiety are all perfectly normal.\nIf you’re trying to recover from injury, it’s easy to feel like you have to do it perfectly or you’ll make things worse. We live in a time of information overload and optimization- so it’s common to have the feeling “If I’m not doing this perfectly, I’m making things worse.”\nBut the reality is that the body is incredibly resilient. And a lot of research shows that movement is always better than no movement at all. Don’t let analysis-paralysis keep you from moving your body more.\nEven if you’re not sure you’re doing the exercises correctly, getting up and moving around is better than sitting still.\nAnd if you’re still feeling unsure about your ability to recover, consider working with an online coach while you’re at home.\nA coach can help you understand the exercises you need to do and can provide reassurance that you’re on the right track.\nThe bottom line is that you need to feel confident that you’re helping your body get better. Whatever you need to get to that confidence is important!\nHow can I make it easier for me to do what I need to do? §\nSo many blogs and books have been devoted to building up your habits. (Start with Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg 2)\nMy favorite way to make things easier is to reduce the friction involved. That means making it as easy as possible to do the things you need to do.\nThere are many ways to do this- and to start listing them would end up focusing on hacks and not the principles.\nIf I say “Set up a dedicated spot to exercise” or “Always do your rehab at the same time,” these both rely on the principle that having a dedicated time and place makes it easier for the brain to remember to do it.\nYou can try different things, as long as you’re making it easy for yourself.\nIf you’re feeling resistance, step back and ask “How can I make this come from a place of ease and flow?”\nIt’s important to know yourself. What has worked for you in the past? Why did it work? Is there a way to replicate that again?\nThe best way to find out is to experiment. Try something new and see if it works. If it does, great! If not, try something else.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, brainstorm with a friend or coach.\nThey may have some great ideas that you haven’t thought of. Injury recovery is never fun. But by following these tips, you can make it a little easier on yourself.\nAnd the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll be back to moving!\n\nFootnotes §\n\n\nFetching Title#ad1l ↩\n\n\nFetching Title#0joe ↩\n\n\n"},"Notes/How-to-make-things-look-effortless":{"title":" How to make things look effortless ","links":["Notes/Develop-a-Plug-and-Play-System-to-10x-Results","Maps/Concepts-MOC","Notes/Work-on-the-Invisible-Things"],"tags":["-willpower-","-effort-","-systems-","-coaching-","-concept-"],"content":"Somehow, Stephen King can write a book a year.\nHe makes it look so effortless.

I’m not sure what to take or how to think about it, but I know that it can be helpful. Here’s how to think about dietary supplements when you’re recovering from injury.\nFirst, it’s important to get clearance from your doctor before you start taking any supplements.

In fact, they should be used to complement a healthy diet.\nSecond, choose supplements that are specific to your needs. If you’re trying to improve your joint health, for example, there are specific supplements that can help with that.\nThird, work with a registered dietitian or other nutrition professional to create a plan that’s right for you. They can help you figure out what supplements you need and how to take them.\nFinally, be patient. It takes time for your body to heal. The supplements you take now may not show results for weeks or even months. But if you’re consistent and focus on a healthy recovery, you’ll get there.\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of whether or not to take dietary supplements when recovering from an injury.

You don’t want to risk making things worse but you also don’t want to sit on the sidelines forever. Here’s what you need to know to find the right balance. Injuries are never fun.\nWhether you’re a world-class athlete or a weekend warrior, getting sidelined with an injury is never fun. It’s frustrating, can be discouraging, and can set you back from your training and goals.\nBut just because you’re injured doesn’t mean you have to sit on the sidelines forever. In fact, if you’re careful and take the right precautions, you can get back to your activities much sooner than you think.\nOf course, the key word here is “careful.” Pushing yourself too hard too soon can lead to further injury, so it’s important to find the right balance.\nThat’s where pacing comes in.\nPacing is all about finding the right balance between pushing yourself and taking it easy. It’s about listening to your body and giving it the time it needs to heal.\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to pacing, but there are some general guidelines you can follow.\nFirst, start with low-impact activities and gradually increase the intensity as you feel ready.\nIf you’re a runner, for example, start with walking and then add in some light jogging when you’re feeling good. Don’t try to pick up where you left off before your injury.\nSecond, don’t be afraid to back off if you start to feel pain or discomfort.\nIt’s normal to feel some pain and discomfort as you’re getting back into activity, but it shouldn’t be severe. If it is, take a step back and reassess.\nFinally, be patient.\nInjuries can take time to heal, so don’t expect to be back to 100% overnight. Pacing yourself and giving your body the time it needs will pay off in the long run.\nOf course, the best way to pace yourself is with the help of a coach or professional. They can help you create a plan that’s tailored to your individual needs and goals.\nBut even if you don’t have a coach, following the tips above can help you find the right balance and get back to your activities safely.\nPacing yourself is key when recovering from an injury. You don’t want to risk making things worse, but you also don’t want to sit on the sidelines forever.

running out of water §\nI don’t think I’ve ever been TRULY thirsty in my life.\nI’ve thought about it,\nand was trying to come up with a time\nwhen I remember truly being thirsty and worried about my next drink.\nBut I’ve got nothing.\nThe closest I can think of is one time when I climbed Mount Mariveles in Bataan last year.\nIt was a 6 hour hike and I stupidly brought just one liter of water.\nI didn’t know what I was getting into\nAnd I wasn’t prepared.\nSo by the time I reached summit,\nI had already run out of water,\nand I was only 3 hours into the trek.\nI was going to have to head back down the mountain without any water at all.\nWas I thirsty?\nSure I wanted a drink.\nBut was I DYING of thirst?\nThat seems a bit extreme.\nI was uncomfortable for sure.\nI wanted it to end.\nI was REALLY looking forward to getting a drink.\nBut I definitely was not at the point where I could think of nothing but water.\nEating Dried Fish §\nThis does remind me of a story from the spiritual tradition:\n“A novice in the seminary wished to have a vision of Jesus Christ in his dreams,\nbut despite his best efforst to contemplate and meditate,\nhe was incapable of achieving this vision.\nSo he approached his superior and asked for advice.\nHis superior said:\n‘My son, this evening, you must eat a lot of salted fish (daing),\nthen perform your prayers and go to bed without drinking any water.\nThen you will receive your vision.’\nThe novice followed this advice\nThat night, he spent the whole night dreaming he was drinking from streams, fountains and springs.\nWhen morning came, he ran crying to his superior:\n“O Master, I did not have my vision of Christ.\nI was so thirsty that all I dreamed about was drinking from fountains and springs.\nI am still on fire with thirst.”\nAnd his superior told him:\n“So eating salter fish gave you such a thirst that you dreamed all night of nothing but water.\nNow you must feel the same thirst for Jesus,\nand you will behold him in his blessed beauty.”\nIt is a simple story to make a quick point.\nWhen you’re really thirsty you can only think about one thing.\nWhether it’s water, or seeing Jesus, it has to be the only thing on your mind\nHave you ever desired anything so much that it consumed all your thoughts?\nWhat is your most powerful desire?\nWhat are you most thirsty for?\nJesus’ thirst §\nIn John’s Gospel, when Jesus knew that all was finished, he said “I am thirsty.”\nUsual interpretations talk about Jesus’ thirst for his people.\nHe desires our salvation.\nHe is thirsty for souls.\nHe wants to deliver the world from sin.\nThese are beautiful interpretations.\nAnd today I’m noticing how uncomfortable it feels.\nLike running out of water on a hike\nLike eating salted fish without water\nThirst isn’t just desire.\nIt’s desire to the point of physical discomfort\nIt’s about squirming in bed from being thirsty.\nIf it’s about wanting so bad that it’s physically uncomfortable,\nI can’t think of any better description of Jesus being on the cross.\nHe is so focused on what he wants that it hurts.\nQuite literally\nHe desires our salvations so much that it’s the only thing he can think about.\nThat’s what I see when I see a thirsty Jesus on the cross.\nWhat is it like to desire one thing only so much that I cannot think about anything else?\nWhat physical thirst feels like §\nThe physiologists who specialize in thirst seem never to have experienced it.\nThis surprises me.\nYou would think that someone interested in thirst would want to stop drinking for a while.\nIt is easy to arrange, and can be done safely.\nBut the physiologists pursue knowledge, not experience.\nThey use words based in Greek, which soften the subject.\nFor instance, they would describe the Sahara — the burning sand, the fierce, relentless sky — as dipsogenic, meaning “thirst-provoking.”\nIn discussing Lag Lag’s case, they might say he progressed from eudipsia, meaning “ordinary thirst,” through bouts of hyperdipsia, meaning “temporary intense thirst,” to polydipsia, by which they mean “sustained, excessive thirst.”\nWe can define it more precisely: since poly means “many,” polydipsia means “the kind of thirst that drives you to drink anything. ”\nThere are specialized terms for such behavior, including uriposia, “the drinking of urine,” and hemoposia, “the drinking of blood.”\nFor word enthusiasts, this is heady stuff.\nNonetheless, the lexicon has not kept up with technology.\nBlame the ancients for not driving cars.\nI have tried, and cannot coin a suitable word for “the drinking of radiator coolant.”\nGetting pulled in different directions §\nI am struck by how this is so VERY not my experience today.\nUnlike Jesus on the cross, I feel like I’m pulled in a thousand different directions.\nOne minute I’m thinking about writing this sharing\nThen I’m jumping to a YouTube video\nSuddenly my Viber rings and there’s a message.\nI hear the doorbell and a delivery has arrived.\nWhat was I doing again?\nOh yes! I was writing\nHmm. I wonder what’s for dinner\nding another notification\nMy mind is all over the place (At best)\nAnd tends to feel hijacked (at worst)\nWork, social media, chores, errands\nI need to go to the bank.\nI need to pick this my clothes.\nMy experience today is that\nI am SO not able to focus on one thing only.\nThere’s a reason the movie\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\nwas so popular last year.\nWhy choose one thing when I can be everything?\nWhy choose one place when I can be everywhere?\nWhat is happening in this world?\nWhat are all these gadgets?\nWho are these people?\nIt’s all TOO much.\nI need it to stop.\nTrying to stop the noise §\nHow can I stop being pulled apart?\nMediation?\nMindfulness?\nPrayer?\nBrathing?\nIsn’t that all the range now.\nGo on another retreat\nAttend another talk\nDownload a new meditation app\nRead another book on contemplation\nIt’s not stopping.\nSomehow it isn’t exactly what I’m thirsty for.\nSpirituality of Imperfection §\nI’m reminded of St. Thérèse of Lisieux\nwho shares a story from her childhood.\nWhen her older sister, Léonie was getting too old to play with her dolls,\nshe put them in a basket with the dolls and play dresses.\nShe gave them to her younger sisters, Céline and Thérèse.\nsaying, “Here dears, choose whichever one you like.”\nCéline saw a ball of wool that she wanted, and took that.\nTwo year old Thérèse looks at the basket, the dolls, and the dresses, and declares “I choose everything.” And she took the whole basket with her.\nI also want everything §\nAnd I feel this in myself too-\nI want everything.\nI want to a be in prayer and in mass,\nbut when I am there I also want to think about other things.\nI want to choose simplicity,\nbut I also want comfort, travel, or the many great experiences of this world.\nI want to live humbly,\nbut I also want a good repuation, to be respected and liked by people around me.\nI want everything.\nThe man who wills one thing §\nThe cleanest definition of saintfood for me comes from Soren Kirekegaard\nwho said: “to be a saint, it to will the one thing.”\n“to be a saint, it to will the one thing.”\nNot to be distracted.\nNot to lose focus.\nNot to try to choose everything.\nBut to choose one thing only.\nIt is not easy to be so single minded- to will one THE ONE THING\nBut this Jesus on the cross\nWhen Jesus is on the cross, and he says he’s thirsty-\nThat is his singular focus\nHis powerful desire\nThat he only wants one thing\nAnd nothing else matters\nHe doesn’t want it all\nHe want one thing only\n“Seek first the kingdom, and all things shall be added”\nWhy am I not thirstier? §\nSo why am I stuck?\nWhy am I distracted?\nWhy am I not thirsty enough?\nWhy is my mind going from place to place to place to place?\nWhy can’t I be thirsty for God to the point that God is all I can think about?\nI have been truly thirsty in the past §\nI said at the start that I haven’t been TRULY thirsty in my life.\nBut I realize that’s not completely true.\nDuring the pandemic, I was not physically allowed to go to mass. And while I am grateful that we could participate in online mass— I could feel myself getting thirstier and thirstier.\nI didn’t want to just take in sips\nI wanted to drink deeply\nI was so thirsty then…\n15 years ago I lived in China for 1 year.\nI visited a town where there was 1 church in the whole city.\nAnd it was a good 3 hour drive from where I was\nThere was only 1 church in the whole city, and it was a 2 hour drive.\nWhen I went to mass it was completely different.\nNo mumbling of prayers and ‘Our Fathers’\nNo half hearted responses\nJust true thirst- and people so thankful to be drinking Living Water.\nWater is only valuable, and amazing for the person who is truly thirsty.\nAnd Living Water is life giving, only to the person who has this thirst too.\nIsaiah 55:1-2 §\nMy all-time favorite verse in the bible is from the book of Isaiah\n1 \n“Ho, every one who thirsts, \ncome to the waters; \nand he who has no money, \ncome, buy and eat! \nCome, buy wine and milk \nwithout money and without price. \n2 \nWhy do you spend your money for that which is not bread, \nand your labor for that which does not satisfy? \nHearken diligently to me, and eat what is good, \nand delight yourselves in fatness. \nYou will hear this verse again during the Easter Vigil Mass.\nBut I love this verse because of its promise.\nIt’s so simple and clear.\nAre you thirsty?\nThis will quench your thirst.\nAre you tired? Are you hungry?\nThis will fill you up.\nIsaiah makes it sound so simple—\nand in many ways it is simple.\nBut it’s not always easy to do.\nNot because Living Water is not there.\nBut because I forget how thirsty I actually am.\nRemembering my thirst §\nFace to face mass is back.\nI haven’t been to China in a long time\nAnd I’m already forgetting how thirsty I was those 15 years ago\nI’m already forgetting how thirsty I was just 2 years ago!\nI forget how thirsty I STILL am today\nJumping from my phone,\nto the TV,\nto my work,\nto my errands\nIt’s like drinking juice,\nthen coffee,\nthen a coke,\nand an iced tea\nBut never drinking Living Water.\nThat one thing that can quench my thirst.\nAnd remembering that I am thirsty is the challenge\nIt’s a hard choice to will the one thing,\nAnd sustaining the emotional, physical, and spiritual asceticism needed to protect that choice.\nJesus is thirstier than I’ve ever been §\nWhen Jesus on the cross says he is thirsty.\nWhat does he mean?\nI don’t know.\nWhat I know today is that his thirst is desire and focus.\nIt is the single dedication to the ONE thing that matters above all and more than anything else.\nJesus wants it so bad that it hurts.\nIt’s physically uncomfortable.\nJesus wants more than anything to do the fathers will\nBack to the hike §\nWhen I was at the top of that mountain, going on my hike, running out of water at the summit, with 3 hours left to go.\nI think I was thirsty up there too.\nI go up to mountains because there are no screens.\nThere’s no work.\nThere’s no signal.\nIt’s just me and God’s creation.\nBeing up there reminds me of what matters.\nAnd it’s a reminder to be thirsty.\nBut I’ll still bring more water with me next time I hike"},"Notes/I-thought-GMB-would-be-my-workout-for-life":{"title":"I thought GMB would be my workout for life","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I thought GMB would be my workout for life\nThat doesn’t exists\nBut they still made me fitforlife"},"Notes/I-want-to-be-a-trusted-go-to-source":{"title":"I want to be a trusted go to source","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Becoming a trusted source §\nWe can do this by.\nGetting good info\nGiving good value\nTeaching about something\nVision §\nI would like FFL to be the trusted source for health mindsets and practical advice\nI would like EBB to be the trusted source for reducing waste lifestyle"},"Notes/I'll-be-happier-when-I-lose-weight":{"title":"I'll be happier when I lose weight","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/goal-setting-exercise?utm_source=marketingcloud&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=101321-NewsletterAudience-SmartestCoachIssue13"},"Notes/I'm-not-trying-to-be-perfect.-Just-a-little-bit-better":{"title":"I'm not trying to be perfect.

I’ve felt this pull myself, the desire to perfect each detail before progressing. Yet, there’s a compelling argument for velocity—a principle that most narratives can be amplified by diving headfirst into the fray, cutting through the preamble to where the heart of the action pulses.\nThe creative spirit thrives on uninhibited expression, on the raw surge of ideas that comes from unshackled thought. It’s about getting down the clay to be molded, not worrying about the sculpture’s sheen—that comes later. The draft is the creator’s playground, where the internal critic is barred entry, ensuring the free flow of innovation isn’t dammed by premature judgement.\nFor me, this insight is a call to arms, an incitement to accelerate into action. It’s a reminder that the essence of productivity isn’t found in the flawless first pass but in the courage to commence—imperfectly, messily, but decidedly. In practice, this means letting the first page go, metaphorically or literally, and not allowing the analytical mind to stifle the generative one.\nEmbracing this duality of roles, where the creator blazes ahead and the editor meticulously trails, might just be the key to not only starting more projects but to finishing them with greater satisfaction. It’s a lesson in dynamics, an understanding that pace and patience are not adversaries but allies in the art of creation.\n\nRead more at: Interview: Kevin Kelly, editor, author, and futurist\nYou may also be interested in: The Paradox of Endless Opportunities"},"Notes/Ill-effects-of-competition":{"title":"Ill effects of competition","links":["Notes/Societal-expectations-about-competition"],"tags":["-on/competition-motivation--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nGladwelll\nWhy Do Half of Australia’s Young Swimmers Drop Out Before High School?\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nHe’s just suggesting that we need to be mindful of the psychologically debilitating effects of badly constructed age-class competition.\nSee also §\nSocietal expectations about competition"},"Notes/Imagination-as-a-social-good":{"title":"Imagination as a social good","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/imagination","tags/on/change","tags/society"],"tags":["permanent-note","imagination","on/change","society"],"content":"topic: 202112141619- Imagination as a social good\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#imagination#on/change#society\nurl: §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nWe think imagination is something that’s completely frivolous\nIt’s a complete waste of time, and something that’s only for people who don’t have real things to worry about. It’s for the artists, writers and dreamers.\nBut what if it turns out that imagination is THE single most useful thing for society\nA quick cliche example- Steve Jobs took the time to imagine a beautiful cellphone\nAnd he completely changed the world because of that. In a sense, imagination became the most powerful and practical thing in society.

It’s no surprise. The forces of psychic entropy must constantly be held at bay.\nPsychic Entropy encompasses anything that leads to a feeling of chaos. It’s a frenetic energy. It’s feeling scatter-brained, constantly distracted, overwhelmed, overrun, and burnt out. It’s a constant battle; and we must be diligent. We will be bent, bowed, and bloodied. We will lose our way countless times.\nThat’s where it’s good to know which habits are important for you. For me, my important habits all are small things I can do. And Small Wins foster a Sense of Control.\nHere are three basic important habits:\n\nPreparing for the next day is an important habit\nJournaling in the morning is an important habit\nWriting down daily goals in the morning is an important habit\n\nIt’s also worth checking out Resiliency Routines help regain a sense of control, which highlight a pattern of “waking early, journaling, and working out”as a means to regain a sense of control in one’s life.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2014-06-28\ncreated:: 2014-06-28\nmodified:: 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Imposter-syndrome-might-have-a-better-term":{"title":"Imposter syndrome might have a better term","links":["Notes/Don't-confuse-rate-vs-actual-knowledge"],"tags":[],"content":"Changing the language of imposter syndrome §\nBecause calling it imposter syndrome sounds a bit negative\nBut maybe it’s semantic\nImposter Syndrom is when confidence is lower than competence\nIt’s the opposite of\nDon’t confuse rate vs actual knowledge]\nIf you have imposter syndrome\nand your confidence is lower than your competence\nIt draws you to learn more\nand it leads you to listen to other people\nSo overcoming imposter syndrome.\nIs not really your goal\nBecause you always want to be listening and learning from others\nIt’s a good virtue\nLanguage things §\nSo the paradox is, if you’re the right kind of learner- you’ll always feel like an imposter\nBut that’s not a bad thing\nBecause it means that if you’re doing things in the right way\nyou’ll always be wanting to learn and you’ll always feel like you don’t know enough"},"Notes/Improving-Micro-Habits-at-the-Point-of-Contact":{"title":"Improving Micro Habits at the Point of Contact","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","tags/on/pd","Notes/Aikido"],"tags":["habit","on/pd"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit,#on/pd\nImproving Micro Habits at the Point of Contact §\nMicro Habits: These are super tiny, hidden habits that happen without us usually being aware of them; but that can majorly impact our state of mind.\nMicro Habits happen at a moment called “The Point of Contact”\nThe Point of Contact\nThe Point of Contact (POC) is not a contact you have with an external stimulus. Rather, it’s a contact with your internal response to an external stimulus.\nIt’s an emotion, thought, feeling, impulse or bodily sensation exerting an influence on your current state of mind.\nIf you can bring awareness to your micro habits during these consequential points of contact, you can make sure not to get derailed by them.\nThe POC emerges out of the fog of the subconscious. Sometime we pinpoint it sooner than other times. Whenever we do, we engage the dual-mind.\nThe Dual Mind\nThe Dual Mind refers to the conscious/subconscious minds.\nWe need to develop the skills, awareness, and intuition to identify POCs that can derail our day; so we can effectively deal with them like a master in Aikido would.\nTwo Micro Habits to improve: §\n\nRecognize harmful POCs\nEffectively deal with harmful POCs\n\nThis is about winning the point of contact.

I was so afraid that was it. I had hurt myself, and I would never be as strong again.\nI nervously went in to see a doctor, who told me that I needed surgery. So I agreed, I went into it. When I woke up from surgery the doctor told me:\n“Hey you’re up- The surgery was great, your knee is now better than new.” \nI was so relieved and grateful. And I went on to get back to my sports and hobbies.\n—\nNow for Doctor #2,\nIn 2020, I was having some nerve pain going down my arm. This was a new and unfamiliar injury, so I wanted to make sure it was nothing serious.\nLike last time, I nervously went to see a doctor. She did some tests and then told me\n“You’ve got a pinched nerve. We can treat it, but it’s also going to keep coming back again and again and again.”\nThat was not reassuring, and actually quite scary. I didn’t know what I could do.\nAnd it turned out to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nI got more worried, more stressed, and more anxious. That made my body more tense and tight. Which made my nerve pain worse!\n—\nEver since then I’ve been on a journey to understand pain more. And today I want to talk about how your beliefs, what your doctor says actually matters a lot.\nOne big thing we are learning is that there’s much more to injury and pain than just the physical\nPart of that is our social environment. Here’s a great clip that sums it up\nWhen a kid falls down, they first look to their parents to see how they should react.\nIf they react with fear and worry, the child learns that\nIf they are calm, and they say it’s okay- we learn that too.\nThe parents’ response actually informs how they interact and understand pain\nThat means pain and how we react to it is learned\n—\nPlus there’s the curious case of placebo surgeries.\nWhat happens here is that doctors did a fake operation.\nBut people improved just as much as people who got real operations.\nI’m not saying all surgery and medicine is a sham.

Worry about structure later.\nIf you’ve got around 100-500 notes\nSome of your favorite notes will become harder to find. You’ll start to desire a way to structure and organize your notes.

Sure, it’s awesome, but you can’t leap to “11” and bypass counting “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10”. The only structure that can work over time, is the structure that slowly emerges over time—validating its own existence through its use.\nThis kit shows you how to get there, but DO NOT start structuring your “ultimate” system right now. It will fail you, because it will be fragile, because it wasn’t forged in the fire of practical usage. You will waste time and enthusiasm—and could possibly burn out.\n\nLet the links do the work.\n\nSo Trust the process (kit) and enjoy the incremental journey of structure emerging organically. As you run into Mental Squeeze Points keep these principles in mind. Keep them handy. But try to stop yourself from over-designing everything today. It won’t be helpful.

This word started to really pick up steam in the 1980s when young, seemingly healthy executives in Japan would suddenly die. Having insane working hours (110 hours a week), and highly stressful responsibilities all contributed to their demise.\nIn English, we have words like “fatigued” or “burnt out,” though those don’t quite capture the severity of working yourself to the point where you are actively hurting your body. You’re so focused on work that you’re killing yourself.\nI think in fitness, there’s a “death by overwork” culture also.\nThe Problem with “No Pain, No Gain.” §\nEvery time I see an Instagram post that talks about “Going past your limits,” or “Pushing your body to the extreme,” I cringe a little bit.\nI mean, I get it. Some people love this language. It motivates. It gets them moving. It lets them run that marathon. Or force out that extra pull up.\nBut I’m afraid that the prevalence of this “No Pain, No Gain” mindset is setting us all up for some big problems down the line.\nShouldn’t I push myself in my workouts? §\nBut isn’t pushing yourself part of how you improve and get stronger? If you’re too comfortable when training, you won’t ever progress.\nYes, that’s true. So here’s where we can make a distinction. (And be fair to the “no pain, no gain-ers.”)\nChallenging yourself and putting yourself in some discomfort helps stimulate growth. It’s true in fitness and in life. If you stay in your comfort zone all the time, you won’t grow as an individual.\nBut similarly, if you’re always in discomfort, pushing yourself in your life. And then losing out on sleep. Getting sick. Continuing past that. Well… you get “Karoshi”- “death by overwork.” It’s that extreme that I want to be careful to avoid. And I think in our culture, we have a tendency to encourage overwork.\nYes, you must challenge yourself. But in the process, ever ignore your pain. If your knees hurt. Or if you can’t even get out of bed in the morning. That’s your body telling you that you’re overdoing it. You’ve gone past “challenging” and have entered into “damaging.”\nTrading off a short term fix, for long term challenges (analogy) §\nThink of it like a car, which is full of many intricate parts. I can push its performance, but only for so long. After a while, things will start to wear out. That check engine light will turn on.\nIn our bodies, pain is that “check engine light.” It will turn on when you push your body too much, and if you ignore it, things will only get worse.\nThe best thing to do would be to pull back. Address what needs to be addressed. And then use your car, and your body well. It will be useful, more efficient, and more long lasting.\nThe Long Term Cost §\nThe way so many people are training now- they’re driving their bodies to the point of getting wrecked. It’s “Karoshi” in fitness. “Death by overwork-out.”\nAnd the real long term cost shows up when you find that you’re in too much pain to get a good night’s sleep. Or you don’t have the energy to spend time with your friends and family. Or ultimately, you have health and body problems that limit your freedom, and prevent you from doing things.\nSolution: Going back to motivation §\nOne way to recalibrate is to ask yourself a simple question\n“What am I working out for anyway?”\nIs it a sense of accomplishment?\nIs it because I want to be healthier?\nIs it because I want to live long?\nDo I want to be present for my family and kids?\nWhatever it might be, framing your workouts this way can help you find that balance.\nIt’s a bit cliche, but when you hear\n“work to live, and not live to work,”\nyou can apply the same kind of thinking to working out\nWe “Workout to live, not live to workout.”\nDoes my exercise routine let me do the things I want to do and live the life I want to live?\nIf I want to live a healthy, happy life and be present to my friends and family. Then as cool as it might be to run really fast or jump really high, I can remember that it might affect my knees, and hurt my ability to stick to my real goals.\nThat’s the key idea:\nYour life is what you’re trying to be fit for."},"Notes/JFK-Fitness-Speech":{"title":"JFK Fitness Speech","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://youtu.be/E0WmpszjnN8\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/James-Clear-Quote":{"title":"James Clear Quote","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"James Clear Quote §\n“You do not rise to the level of your goals\nYou fall to the level of your systems”"},"Notes/James-Flyn-Psychometrician-Capitalization":{"title":"James Flyn Psychometrician Capitalization","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"James Flyn Psychometrician Capitalization §"},"Notes/James-clear's-steps-to-change":{"title":"James clear's steps to change","links":["Atomic-Habits"],"tags":[],"content":"James clear’s steps to change §\nSource: §\n\nAtomic Habits\n\nKey Ideas §\n\n\nStep 1: Decide who you want to be\n\n\nStep 2: Prove it to yourself with small wins\n\n\nIn the twelve steps programs, they have a saying:\n\n“Bring the Body and the mind will follow”\n\n\n"},"Notes/James-steele-defines-effort-as":{"title":"James steele defines effort as","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Effort according to James Steele §\nJames Steel defines effort as the ratio of the demands of the task to the capacity to meet those demands.\nHe uses it to measure and to quanitify effort and how much one feels like they’re doing.\nSource:\nThe movement podcast"},"Notes/Jasper-and-AI-AIauthor":{"title":"Jasper and AI AIauthor","links":[],"tags":["--"],"content":"The Rapid Book Outline Method\n(Jasper Recipe)\nThe AI Author\nAI Author Core Worksheets\n\n\nIdeal Customer Avatar\n\n\nSetting Goals and Knowing Competition\n\n\nFind your spine and content brief\n\n\n\nPublisher Rocket\nOnePage.io"},"Notes/Javier-Thank-You-GIF":{"title":"Javier Thank You GIF","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Jill-Hawkins":{"title":"Jill Hawkins","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Jiro-dreams-of-sushi-(Raw-Materials-story)":{"title":"Jiro dreams of sushi (Raw Materials story)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Jiro dreams of sushi (Raw Materials Story) §\nWant to make good sushi?\n80% of the work happens at 3am in the Tsukiji fish market"},"Notes/John-Didian-Quote":{"title":"John Didian Quote","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"We tell ourselves stories in order to live"},"Notes/John-Mayer-Belief":{"title":"John Mayer Belief","links":["Notes/Homo-Adorans-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"John Mayer Belief Song (story) §\nSource: §\n\nHis Performance with Ed Sheeran\n\nKey Ideas: §\n\nIt’s a good way of communicating that you’ll worship something\n\nSee also: §\n\nHomo Adorans (concept)\n"},"Notes/John-of-the-Cross-and-Unending-Depths":{"title":"John of the Cross and Unending Depths","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/John-of-the-Cross-in-Prison":{"title":"John of the Cross in Prison","links":["Notes/John-of-the-Cross-and-Unending-Depths","tags/permanent-note","tags/john-of-the-cross","tags/abandonment","tags/on/depression","Notes/The-way-of-knowing-not"],"tags":["permanent-note","john-of-the-cross","abandonment","on/depression"],"content":"topic: John of the Cross and Unending Depths\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#john-of-the-cross#abandonment#on/depression §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nIn 1577, at the age of 35, John of the Cross was thrown into a prison.\nHe was trying to reform his Carmelite order.

The media - with its news, advertisements, and myriad of distractions - is only a click (or tap) away. (Or with phone “notifications” we don’t even have to do anything to have our mental focus  hijacked by the avalanche of distractions that haven’t earned the right to steal our attention). In this constant buzz of noise-feces, we lose touch with more than just our goals; we lose touch with ourselves - our intuition, our own thoughts, our voice, our own opinion, and the very sense of individuality that makes each of us unique. This is an invisible war for the soul, and we are losing — badly. By all external measures we can claim freedom, yet in the place where it matters most, in our ability to think and question and act on our own volition, we have unwittingly given up our minds to be shackled by the forces of outside stimuli. Stimuli that tells us how to think, that manipulates our emotions, making us incredulously angry at someone or some issue we’ve never met or likely don’t truly understand, and telling us how to feel about it, and giving us talking points for what to share about it. The low-hanging fruit of distraction is tempting, especially when our guard is down or our willpower is low. At these moments, we unconsciously and voluntarily relinquish the rights to our minds to the loudest megaphone. We willingly allow our mind to be hijacked. We place our head in the scabbard, we lock the gate and forget the key, we sleepwalk into slavery - a prison for the mind.\nHopefully now it’s clear that the Morning Journal is a fight for control over your life, because it’s a battle for your mind. It’s a fight for your authenticity. It’s a war for the very essence of who you are. It reconnects you to you.

We often find ourselves setting up goals as finish lines, but the reality is, reaching a goal simply shifts the goalpost further down the field. Instead of asking, “When will I get there?” maybe the better question is, “Am I getting better each day?”\nIn the context of my coaching practice, I recognize the need to focus on systems, whether it’s improving client interactions, streamlining the sales process, or enhancing the quality of my programs. Call by call, rep by rep, we get closer to mastery. Sometimes, I find it exhausting but there’s a strange satisfaction in doing the work, day in and day out. It’s not about the end game; it’s about the game itself.\nThis ethos reminds me of the principle of hormesis in stress management. Just as low doses of stress can induce a healthy adaptation, the daily grind—when approached with the right mindset—can yield incremental yet significant gains.\nSo, let’s not get lost in the cycle of constantly chasing ‘there’. After all, once you get ‘there’, you’ll realize it’s the new ‘here’. What truly matters is the meaningful progress you make along the way, because “getting there” is a moving target but getting better is the real game.\n\nRead more at: https://medium.com/@ramirezrafael3434/the-power-of-perseverance-keep-grinding-towards-success-fabaf3509521\nYou may also be interested in: computer and human thinking"},"Notes/K.-Anders-Ericsson-(kit)":{"title":"K.

I am 100% fully present.\nThere’s something about exploring, wandering, and even getting lost that is freeing. If I know I’m generally safe, my brain is finally allowed to relax and take in all the new stimuli around me. Everything is so fresh and new.\nIt’s a feeling I love. \nBeing open and seeing with fresh eyes. It happens when I travel, but I can experience it in other ways. When I’m learning a new skill or reading a nice book. I experience it when I’m exploring new ideas.\nIt’s a feeling of being alive and present in the moment. And it’s something I crave when I start to feel like my life is getting too routine.\nWhenever I feel stuck, or like I’m just going through the motions, I try to find ways to get lost. I go for a drive. I will try to visit a new place. It gives my brain that jump start to feel awake and aware.\n10 years later, I feel that way less and less.\nWhere has all the attention gone? §\nIt would be so easy to rant against social media and the internet here.\nAt the risk of being the elder millennial waving from his porch at the world, it’s just so damn convenient to stay inside, watch some YouTube, work from home, and stay in this little pod I made for myself. Going outside takes way more work than (I feel like) it used to.\nThese are the questions that are burning in my mind now:\n\nHow did it get so easy to zone out?\nWhy did we let it get this way?\nAre there any ideas on ‘attention’ that I resonate with? (Be it neuroscience, philosophy, theology, psychology)\n\nWhat can I do to get my attention back?\nSimone Weil on the Importance of Attention in Everyday Life §\n\nI first encountered Simone Weil in graduate school, and she’s been on and off my beside books for so many years. I cannot claim to really understand her thinking. The words are so mysterious and impenetrable- it feels like the ramblings of a wild, free mind.\nBut every once in a while, one of her ideas will strike a chord. I will happen to be at just the right place and time in my life where her words resonate fully.\nToday that is Weil’s ideas on attention.\nIn her own words:\nFor Weil, attention is a “negative effort,” one that requires that we stand still rather than lean in.\nI find this definition painful and exciting. The paradox in talking about effort in standing still is so amazing to me. I think of meditation, and mindfulness and how fucking hard it is to just stand still.\nIn a way, it is easier to lean in- to move- to take action- to be hasty and to make things happen.\nThe effort required in just being still is infuriating.\nAttention is not about focusing on finding answers for Weil. It’s not about getting to the end.\nIt is more about seeing questions and puzzles, and learning to sit with them even if we cannot find the answers. (Like koans in the Zen tradition)\nIn a subject like Mathematics, we can sit for a long time with a geometry problem, and at the end of an hour have made little progress.\nBut in that hour, we will have entered into “another more mysterious dimension” (Weil’s words).\nThis is a moral dimension: It is a space where, by our act of attention, we grasp what has always been the real mystery- the lives of our fellow human beings.\n–\nWhen I was in university, I was a Math student\nI tell people I got into math for the simple clarity that it comes with. There are proofs and there are numbers.\nBut as I advanced in my subjects, the problems got more complex- I was be stumped with problems and questions I couldn’t answer\nI remember this one night where I would lie awake, unable to sleep- thinking about a math problem. I would get up at 1 in the morning. Make some tea and then sit at my desk and continue to explore the possibilities of the problem. That was my favorite moment as a math student. The thrill of a puzzle that was beyond my current grasp.\nMath is not a step by step linear approach. It’s actually a lot of trial and error. Sitting with problems that seem to make no sense.\nMuch like Weil’s attention\n–\nAs I understand it then, attention is not about directing our will and energies into focusing on an issue or a problem. It is like a mystery, it is like getting lost- it’s like wandering around a new city and exploring something new.\nAttention is a preparation. It’s being ready to attend to something that may come across my reality today. It is when I see everything and everyone with a beginner’s mind\nWhen someone comes to my front door, and I send them away because I am busy with things that are imagined. I fail to attend to the reality in front of me\nAttend to the demands of reality, and not a fantasy you imagine\nAttention- a bit of right brain thinking §\nAll this talk about ‘attention’ reminds me of a time I wanted to learn how to draw.\nI am a mediocre artist at best.\nBut I always did envy my friends who could sketch and draw. There is something magical about being able to create something out of thin air, with nothing but a pencil and a scrap piece of paper. My artist friends recommended to the book “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain” by Betty Edwards.\nThere is a famous exercise in the book that involves upside down drawing.\nPicassos-Upside-Down-Man-Drawing-1024x536.webp\nYou can do this yourself to see:\nTake a piece of paper and try to draw the left image.\nIf you’re a beginner, and you try to draw the image on the left, it will be struggle. Your hand won’t cooperate with what you’re trying to do.\nBut simply flip the image around and try again. Draw the image on the right.\nIt will take you longer to do, but when you complete it, you’ll be surprised at how good your drawing actually looks!\nWhy does drawing upside down work? §\nThe short answer is it works because you are not solving, but you are just observing.\nWhen the image is upright, your brain says, “That’s a person in a chair! Okay. Let’s draw a person in a chair.”\nBut flip it around, and suddenly your brain goes, “That’s a weird squiggly line, and I’m just drawing a squiggly line.” 1\nYou’re not solving, you’re just observing.\nThis was a revelation to me.\nI wrote in Part 1 how I love to travel. Because the newness and unfamiliarity of visiting a place makes me more present and more observant. The familiarity of home makes my brain go “I already know what that is!” Travel opens me up.\nThis one exercise in “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain” was a revelation to me.\nIt was the first time I experienced that open-mindedness, curiosity, and “slow brain” without having to leave the four walls of my house. I wasn’t traveling, I was just at home. But I still felt like I was wandering and exploring.\nI never did finish the book.\nOr learn to draw.\nBut that book changed the way I think about thinking. And today I’ll build that to think about attention.\nAttention exists in our “right brain” §\nThere are a few ways that you can use to think about it:\nSome language uses the idea of being left-brained and right-brained (which is what the drawing book used).\nIt’s a bit old-fashioned, but is still used sometimes to distinguish between a more rational problem-solving approach (associated with left brain). Versus a more creative, open, and exploring approach (right brain) 2\nI don’t know if this is exactly what Simone Weil meant when she talked about attention. But it feels similar, or at least it feels right to me. \nIf the goal is not to solve problems and find solutions (left brain) but to be present and open to questions (right brain), then it makes sense to practice right brain activity in any way possible.\nSo when someone says that art, drawing, or music can make you a better person- that can mean that exercising your “right brain” builds up the muscles that help you pay attention.\nThis makes me wonder:\n“What kind of activities can work?”\n“Why don’t we do those activities more often?”\n“How does society, church, or institutions make it harder (or easier) to pay attention?”\nHow religion led my attention astray §\nAs a child growing up, I was always attracted to the rituals of the church. I didn’t understand anything back then, but the church represented mystery, ritual, and wonder to me. It was alluring.\nAs I grew up, I wanted to get closer to the church and understand the mystery that enamored me so much as a child. So I tried to study it. I read up books on Catholicism. I went on to become a Theologian.\nBut I realized too late that if you want to kill your love for something, study it. There’s nothing wrong with a little knowledge, but it doesn’t end there.\nIt’s like trying to get to know someone by reading up about them, instead of spending time with them. You can learn a lot, but you won’t really know them until you spend time with them.\nMy experience of Catholicism now is fully left brain. Critical, always thinking, always using my judging mind\nLately, I have been feeling like I am on the inside of the church looking out. I don’t know why, but I find myself feeling like an outsider, like I don’t belong. But at the same time, I cannot just leave. I don’t think it’s that simple. And it is a strange feeling, because the church has always been such a big part of my life.\nIn the spirit of Weil’s attention, I am not rushing to solutions- I am doing my best to work on the problem. Like a math problem that is difficult to solve. And enjoying that puzzle\nWhy I think religion’s role is to cultivate attention §\nOn top of my own problems with attention, it is difficult to stay in the church if I’m really attending to the reality of the world. \nIt feels like what happens in the church, or what church people care about is so small and trivial compared to what is really important and what really matters in everyday life. It’s not even about justice and the poor.\nFor me it’s a left brain vs right brain thing. I used to be a very logical, left-brained apologist. But the rhythms of my life took me to a right brained space. In a sense, I had to unlearn a lot of what I knew in order to find a new way of being in the world.\nThe church feels like it is stuck in the left brain. It is all about doctrine, and rules, and right and wrong. \nI’m not saying that the church is irrelevant, or that it doesn’t have anything to offer. But it feels like it is so caught up in its own world, that it is missing the bigger picture.\nIt’s not just me. I know there are others who feel the same way. We are the ones who are struggling to stay, because we believe in the church, and we want it to be better. But it is hard, when it feels like the church is not really attending to the needs of the world.\n–\nI used to believe that you could study your way into a new way of becoming. Perhaps this is possible. I’ve certainly had ideas and analogies that were so powerful they completely changed the way I think about my world.\nBut most of the time, I think maybe 95% of the time, it is action that precedes thinking and belief. I think that way I think because of the things I do and who I am. We learn through our bodies. It is not abstractly in the mind.\nWe go on nature hikes, and our right brain wakes up- and we learn to see the world this way.\nIt is the difference between a tour vs a pilgrimage.\nIt is the difference between a zoo, a safari, and a mountain hike\nIt is the difference between music criticism and being at a concert.\nThis is what I feel religion is like.\nWhen people say that they feel closer to God in the mountains, or in some far off wild landscape. They’re not being insane.\n–\n\nAnd yes I’m picking on religion because that’s my experience and it’s easy. But all of society has come to feel this way.\nCivic organizations have become less about civics and more about tribalism, a bit of us versus them.\nCountries used to stand for moral things, and the good of society. Now it also feels like an us versus them\nCorporations are the same too- it’s just left-brained profit driven thinking. I think of food and agriculture, I think of reading, I think of writing. I think of universities. It feels like it’s everywhere.\nAnd we’re not saying to remove everything and burn it all to the ground.\nBut it is a need to escape from the tyranny of the left brain, and open things up to a bit of more right brain experiences.\nWhat Would Simone Weil Say About Religion and Society Today? §\nI’ve set it up pretty easy\nShe’d say to pay attention\nAnd to wait and see\nYes I understand how naive this sounds. But hey I never said I was coming in to solve all these problems.\nI’ve just writing what I think, and how I’m going to go about it.\nThe Outside of the Religion: Where Simone Weil Felt She Belonged §\nSimone Weil has the phrase that she feels like she’s in the outside of the church looking in\nI feel like I’m in the opposite place\nWith utter frankness and humility, she positions herself between the inside and the outside. She surprises herself as much as she does us with her unfolding spirituality, her clarity regarding organized religion, and her union with God. At once lofty and down to earth, a (non-official) convert and critic, Weil is a kindred spirit to anyone who embraces the complexity of life on the periphery and receptiveness to the ever evolving mystery of faith.\nReligion and Society on the right side of the brain §\nWhatever I don’t think we can really change society or religion\nBut maybe you can ask- what are those organizations- secular or religion that turn on the right side of my brain.\nThe interest in meditation\nThe hunger for some kind of meaning\nIt all links to this idea for sure\nSimone Weil’s Legacy: On Attention and Living in the World §\nIn Simone Weil’s thought, we need to be ready for the important things that are before us\nWe shall not cease from exploration\nAnd the end of all our exploring\nWill be to arrive where we started\nAnd know the place for the first time.\nT.S.

It’s a nod to a simpler, more connected way of living. It shifts the focus from mindless consumption to mindful gathering. Shopping “little and often” becomes not just a method but a philosophy. It minimizes waste and maximizes the utility of each purchase, aligning with the principle of living green.\nThe art of foraging, often overlooked, connects us back to the land and makes us participants in our own survival. There’s a sense of accomplishment in finding wild garlic, berries, or even nettles, which are “so underrated,” according to experts.\nThese two practices combined could make for an exciting experiment in sustainable living. They encourage a deeper connection with our environment, and perhaps even with ourselves, as we become more deliberate in our choices.\n\nRead more at: 50 simple ways to make your life greener | Environment | The Guardian\nGo one level up : Homesteading MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Philippines Foraging"},"Notes/Let-grass-grow-for-insects-and-wildlife-(concept)":{"title":"Let grass grow for insects and wildlife (concept)","links":["Notes/How-to-Build-a-Pond"],"tags":[],"content":"Let grass grow for insects and wildlife (concept) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea: §\n\nThis is a new trend in gardening\nThat’s very helpful and is a really good idea\nCreate a beneficial ecosystem\n\nSee also: §\n\nHow to Build a Pond\n"},"Notes/Let-your-subconscious-figure-it-out":{"title":"Let your subconscious figure it out","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Let your subconscious figure it out §\nWatch a video of yourself\nagain and again\nsleep on it\nCome back the next day"},"Notes/Let-yourself-mix-it-up":{"title":"Let yourself mix it up","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202112181551- Let yourself mix it up\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note\nurl: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1471613609008533504 §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nIt’s always a good idea to mix things up once in a while\nIt doesn’t have to be a rapid 180 shift.

This practice goes beyond simple customer satisfaction and transcends into a higher level of customer delight.\nEmotional ROI for Clients\nMike Doehla’s example of giving out gift cards for new clothing is ingenious because it doesn’t just celebrate a milestone; it immortalizes it. When clients wear those new clothes, they feel not just physically transformed but emotionally elevated. That’s a level of service that transcends a mere transaction.\nAn Organic Way to Get Referrals\nLet’s be honest, clients will post their successes on social media anyway. When they attribute part of their success journey to a thoughtful gift you gave, the curiosity it sparks among their circle is bound to lead to natural, unsolicited referrals. The brilliance lies in creating a snowball effect of marketing, without directly asking for it.\nElevating Customer Service by Honoring Transformation\nI’ve often wondered how to inject more depth into my customer service strategy. The notion of “success gifts” answers that perfectly. It offers a way for me to give back while sparking authentic conversations about health and transformation.

While we hail the advances in pharmacology, it’s the primal act of exercise that holds a profound, yet underutilized, sway over our well-being. High-intensity exercise has emerged not just as a competitor to, but as a frontrunner over traditional treatments for depression, outpacing both counseling and medication. It’s a clarion call to those struggling with their mental health, offering a beacon of hope through the vigor of exercise.\nYet, herein lies the paradox: when the fog of depression descends, the very antidote becomes the hardest to ingest. Acknowledging this struggle is crucial. It ties back to the art of positioning – creating an environment where the inertia of depression is met with the least resistance to physical activity.

Trustworthy brands aren’t built in a vacuum.

It’s a siren’s call, seductive yet increasingly recognized as a barrier to genuine self-acceptance and presence in the physical world.\nThe pursuit of self-love is often lauded as the ultimate goal, a modern mantra echoed across various platforms. However, I find solace in a more attainable aspiration: to simply coexist with oneself. To accept the inherent flaws and the ‘brokenness’ of human existence is not to succumb to despair, but to cultivate resilience against life’s relentless tide.\nI’ve come to cherish the concept of guiding the youth, and indeed ourselves, towards this understanding. The disconnection fostered by anonymity online starkly contrasts with the raw, unfiltered realities of life. Embracing our shared imperfections, learning to live with oneself, and finding meaning beyond the quantifiable - these are the cornerstones of a philosophy rooted in the richness of life’s tapestry.\n\nRead more at: You Are You.

But there’s more to love than meets the eye. Far from a one-dimensional, sappy emotion, love is a complex tapestry of care, empathy, and connection. It’s undeniably powerful, yet we’ve marginalized its importance, instead rewarding skepticism as if it’s the only marker of intelligence.\nIt seems that modern society often values the person who can articulate what’s wrong with the world over the one who proposes love as a solution. Skepticism is seen as intellectual; it questions, critiques, and demands evidence. Love, on the other hand, is perceived as blind, unconditional, and sometimes irrational.\nHowever, this perspective is fundamentally skewed. Love is not an antithesis to critical thinking; rather, it’s a complement. It adds a layer of understanding, a way to navigate the complex social dynamics that skepticism alone can’t address. Love is the cornerstone of emotional intelligence, a type of intelligence that’s just as vital as the analytical kind, if not more so.\nThe fact is, skepticism might highlight problems, but love often provides the framework for solving them. Love fosters collaboration, builds trust, and encourages empathy. These are not just flowery ideals but practical skills in navigating human relationships and societal challenges.\nIt’s time we reevaluate the imbalance between skepticism and love. Skepticism has its place; it keeps us from accepting things at face value and challenges us to dig deeper. However, a life led solely by skepticism is incomplete. Love fills the gaps, enriches our experiences, and, most importantly, offers solutions that skepticism alone cannot provide.\nTo genuinely advance as individuals and as a society, it’s crucial to recognize the value of love—not as a naive concept but as a fundamental human experience that has the power to bring about real change.\n\nRead more at: The Levers That Money Can’t Pull\nYou may also be interested in: The Precious Window of Parental Love"},"Notes/Low-Profile-Composting-Toilet":{"title":"Low Profile Composting Toilet","links":[],"tags":["-composting-toilet-"],"content":"https://clivusmultrum.com.au/products/CM-LP-Standard-Package-p156366276\nComposting Toilet where you can use the bidet"},"Notes/Low-back-Pain-and-Low-Back-Extensor-Strength":{"title":"Low back Pain and Low Back Extensor Strength","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Low-context-and-high-context-culture":{"title":"Low context and high context culture","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Low context and high context culture §\nJust to account for some cultural differences\nIn a low context context,\neverything must be said\nvery explicitly\nIn a high context culture\nyou have to read all the cues around things\n—\nI remember when I was teaching those kids at\nCasa Bayanihan\nI had to help them understand\nthat the philippines is a high context culture"},"Notes/Luck-Surface-Area-(concept)":{"title":"Luck Surface Area (concept)","links":["Jason-Roberts"],"tags":[],"content":"Luck Surface Area (concept) §\nSource: §\n\nWealth Strategies Journal\nby Jason Roberts\n\nKey Ideas §\n\nIt’s Luck = Doing * Telling\nThe more you do, the more of your work is out there\nThen when you tell people about it, you’re able to spread your ideas further\n"},"Notes/Ludic-Fallacy":{"title":"Ludic Fallacy","links":["Notes/The-problem-with-experts-jumping-around"],"tags":["-thinking-fallacy-on/bad-thinking-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nTaleb\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nJust because you’re good at a game\nlike chess\nyou think you’re good at real life\nSee also §\nThe problem with experts jumping around"},"Notes/Luxury-Beliefs-and-attachment":{"title":"Luxury Beliefs and attachment","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/luxury-belief","tags/attachment","tags/on/bias"],"tags":["idea-note","luxury-belief","attachment","on/bias"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#luxury-belief#attachment#on/bias\nurl: https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/luxury-beliefs-are-like-possessions?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNDUyNTk2LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo1Mzk4ODc0MSwiXyI6Im4xaUR4IiwiaWF0IjoxNjUyMDMzNjA2LCJleHAiOjE2NTIwMzcyMDYsImlzcyI6InB1Yi04MDAyMzciLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.jDtooqJIaHHIrDguOPQ-c2bNdK5jDZ8ok4uhehTsNR0&amp;s=r\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\n\nBeliefs work like this, too.

Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft’s life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time, received more attention than her writing. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.\nDuring her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children’s book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.\nAfter Wollstonecraft’s death, her widower published a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft’s advocacy of women’s equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.\nAfter two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died 11 days after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Shelley, who would become an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein.\nWikipedia\n"},"Notes/Maslow's-Sailboat-q":{"title":"Maslow's Sailboat?","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/on/psychology","tags/maslow","tags/transcendence","tags/on/self-actualization"],"tags":["permanent-note","on/psychology","maslow","transcendence","on/self-actualization"],"content":"topic: 202204042051- Maslow’s Sailboat?\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#on/psychology#maslow#transcendence#on/self-actualization\nurl: https://www.airr.io/episode/62384a1e4e341c0010cbd469 §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nScott Barry Kaufman, who does a lot of research on Maslow kinda wants to debunk this idea of the hierarchy of needs.\nIt’s not like it’s a ladder where you go from step one to step to step 3 and so on.\nSailboat so that it’s more like things have to line up and then you’ll get going- but luck still plays a factor\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/Maslow's-hammer-(concept)":{"title":"Maslow's hammer (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Concept: Maslow’s hammer §\nThere’s the quote.\nIf your tool is a hammer\nthen everything looks like a nail\nYou need tools\notherwise you’ll just rely on one framework only\nEverything will look like a nail."},"Notes/Mass-man-and-spiritual-barbarism":{"title":"Mass man and spiritual barbarism","links":["Notes/Why-study-history"],"tags":["-history-on/politics-masses-on/democracy--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nPhilosophize This\nRevolt of the Masses\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62b9603162ce94f7a90e5d7e\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nAll diversity (radical diversity)\nends in fascism\nBecause you allow for the diversity of opinions\nThe mass man imposes a kind of spiritual barbarism in the world around them\n(They impose their stupidity of the world)\nSee also §\nWhy study history"},"Notes/Masterly-Inactivity-in-the-Garden":{"title":"Masterly Inactivity in the Garden","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Masterly Inactivity in the Garden §\nSince we were in Bataan for a month, I had to accept that my plants would probably not make it.

It’s okay. Not all of them will do well.

It’s not merely about the tranquility experienced in the moment but about strengthening the mental and emotional faculties to face the challenges that come with innovation and leadership.\nFor me, meditation has become more than a practice; it’s a daily ritual that sharpens my focus and expands my perspective. It’s the silent strength behind my decisions, the pause before the storm of creativity, and the space where clarity emerges amidst chaos.\nThis emphasis on meditation by those at the forefront of thought leadership reinforces its value.

Do you need a strong mind too?\nOf course. Of course. Of course.\nIt’s like only thinking about your health when you’re sick. Obsessing over cures and medicines, but ignoring your health when “things are okay.”\nFor many years, we optimized physical fitness while ignoring mental fitness §\nIn 2017, Kevin Love, a professional basketball player had a panic attack during an NBA game.\nReflecting on that experience:\n\n“In the NBA, you have trained professionals to fine-tune your life in so many areas. Coaches, trainers and nutritionists have had a presence in my life for years. But none of those people could help me in the way I needed when I was lying on the floor struggling to breathe.”\n\nYou can read more about it here: Kevin Love on Mental Health: Everyone Is Going Through Something\nFrom elite athletes to casual exercisers, there’s so much information on how to optimize our bodies\n“These are the best workouts”\n“These are the best diets”\n“This is best pillow and mattress for sleep”\nWe have so many experts on how the body works.\nWhere are the mental fitness experts and coaches?\nHow are you building mental fitness? §\nHow do you work with your saboteurs?\nAll of us have a voice inside that hits us with negative self talk.\nIt tells us we’re not good enough. Or that you shouldn’t have done that. Or that you need to 100% in control. We all have our own flavor of saboteur self talk.\nAre you able to recognize and intercept those voices? Or do you let it take control of your day and hijack you?\nHow are you using your ‘slow brain?’\nMost of the time, we’re thinking in a hyper-rational mode.\nIt’s the kind of thinking that a lot of modern life asks us to do. We have to be critical, rational, always thinking and deciding.\nBut mental fitness comes from a different mode of thinking. One that is more emotional and intuitive.\nA great way to practice this is to do activities that “slow your brain down.”\nWho are you having honest conversations with?\nLast thing that helps a lot is to engage in real honest conversations with people.\nIt can be a close friend, it can be a therapist or a coach, it can be a support group.\nOpen, honest, and vulnerable conversation moves us away from a hyper-rational mode of thinking and builds up our mental fitness."},"Notes/Mental-Squeeze-Point":{"title":"Mental Squeeze Point","links":["Notes/LYT-Kit","tags/pkm","Notes/MOCs-Overview"],"tags":["pkm"],"content":"up:: LYT Kit\ntags::#pkm\nMental Squeeze Point §\nA Mental Squeeze Point is when your unsorted knowledge becomes so messy it overwhelms and discourages you.

This is usually followed by yet another search for the next shiny thing that will make all the difference. \nThe Mental Squeeze Point is an emotion. It’s something you feel, whether or not you’re consciously aware of it. Try to be. Try to be aware of when you feel discouraged, or overwhelmed, or disappointed with yourself, or unhappy with your efforts. It’s possible that’s the form that the mental squeeze point has taken.\nPerhaps the best way to overcome these squeeze points are to create a new safe space to assemble and organize the knowledge you’re currently working on—before it completely overwhelms you.

Consider it a path you carve out from a dense forest, a journey in which you’ve amassed a treasure trove of wisdom (your “knowledge of 100”). Now, your objective is to create a pathway (your “path of 1”) to guide others. This perspective reframes the process as less of an insurmountable mountain and more of a rewarding journey with relatable milestones.\nHere’s where it gets personal: aim for a product that you yourself need or needed. This principle hones in on the authentic problems that you can solve better than anyone else. Maybe it’s a fitness program that makes exercise fun for people who find working out boring. Or perhaps it’s a course that integrates ‘right-brain activities’ into health coaching.\nIn my own experience, the process of product creation is a crucible for learning and self-discovery. For instance, I discovered the critical balance between challenge and comfort when it comes to fostering change—both in myself and my clients. This hands-on wisdom becomes the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of your offering. It isn’t just some off-the-shelf solution; it’s a system refined by your personal journey, making it inherently valuable and less susceptible to those looking for quick profits.\nIn a world where everyone is rushing to make a quick buck, creating a product that is rooted in your own experiences will not only be more genuine but also more effective. It becomes a self-marketing system, and the journey itself teaches you how to make it better. So, let’s not dread the process; let’s embrace it as a quest with the endgame of not just financial stability but meaningful impact.\n\nRead more at: https://thedankoe.com/letters/why-micro-education-businesses-are-the-future-zero-dollars-to-start/\nGo one level up : Creator Economy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Minimum Lovable Product"},"Notes/Midnight-Mile":{"title":"Midnight Mile","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.tracksmith.com/journal/article/midnight-mile-documentary\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-(kit)":{"title":"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/on/people","1990---Flow","Notes/Flow"],"tags":["on/people"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#on/people\ndates:: 1934 - 2021\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi §\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi is the author of 1990 - Flow (not included in the LYT Kit).

You just have to believe that the body is anti-fragile and not fragile (we can get stronger after injuries)\nThe resting state of the human body is pain-free. Pain is your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong and needs to be fixed, Starrett says. The sensation can come from an injury or physical impairment (in which case you should talk to your doctor) but it can also result from tissue stiffness, not moving enough, or sitting weirdly.\nStarrett made it clear that you shouldn’t be walking around sore every day. Working in an office shouldn’t leave you hurting. And if it does, it’s a sign that you need to address the problem. Locate the problem, figure out what system it’s a part of, and find an exercise that will help.\nAccording to Kelly Starrett, you shouldn’t be in pain when you press down on your muscles or stretch them out.\nAdditionally, you should be able to breathe comfortably while you’re working on something. If you’re foam rolling and you’re in agony, stop—you’re doing something wrong.\nStarrett explains that moving well and without pain isn’t a game you can win. There’s no point at which you can declare victory and say you’re done; that your knee is totally fixed and you’ll be able to hop, skip, and jump into your 90s. Modern life is always going to throw you curveballs and you’ll need to adapt.\nThat’s interesting because we are getting to a point where people are understanding the importance of always moving.\nThat reminds me of Antifragility and how it applies to the body\nIt’s similar because the body is something that can get stronger over time\nIt’s different because antifragility applies to the mind, but it can also apply to the body\nIt’s important because we need to adapt and not be perfect if we’re going to grow"},"Notes/Move-with-variety---to-get-help-in-individual-parts":{"title":"Move with variety - to get help in individual parts","links":["Notes/Movement-is-Medicine"],"tags":["--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nMove Your DNA with Katy Bowman\nEp 132: How Movement Fits Into Intentional Aging\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62c69f4e7de2541f98e42148\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThere needs to be variety in movement\nSo move in as many different ways as you can\nSee also §\nMovement is Medicine"},"Notes/Movement-Evolved-Before-Language":{"title":"Movement Evolved Before Language","links":["Todd-Hargrove","Hand-and-Minds-(Highlights)"],"tags":[],"content":"Movement Evolved Before Language §\nSource §\n\nTodd Hargrove in Hand and Minds (Highlights)\n\nKey Idea §\n\nMovement is more primitive and can tap deeper\n"},"Notes/Movement-Puzzles":{"title":"Movement Puzzles","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202112181553- Movement Puzzles\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note\nurl: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1471006860660510721 §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nOne of the problems I have with exercises and movement is that they’re so rote\nIt feels like I’m just going through the motions.

But now, there are machines can do that also. Look at every machine in your life- and see how it’s outsourcing movement in some way. The telelphone is outsourcing the walk to the neighbors.

We don’t need to reinvent the wheel.\nWhoop puts out a number\n\nHere’s Garmin’s version of your body score\n\nHeck even Wii Fit had done this\n\nI wanted to make one as a fun little math problem for myself, and to see how I would make something like this also.\nHere’s the Setup §\nEach client’s first session runs them through a basic bodyweight circuit.\n\n30 seconds per movement\n30 seconds rest in between\n2 rounds total\nIt’s on the easier beside because many of the clients are new to working out, and are more of beginners.\n\nThey do 6 movements\n\nSquats\nDeadlifts\nPush Ups\nPlanks\nMountain Climbers\nDownward Dog\n\nFor each movement, record the number of reps or seconds done.\n\nPlay around with the numbers based on form and variation §\nIf I want to get a score out of 100, I’m going to need to add some variety. I’ll do this with some multiplier modifiers.\nFirst thing I can think of is the form. If the client does 30 push ups, but the form is garbage, they should be penalized by that.\nOn the other hand, if they do 20 push ups with perfect form, that should be a bonus. So I come up with this.\n\nThe numbers are arbitary at this point.\nI can also add a modifier for different variations of the movements.\nFor example, a knee push up should be scoring less than a regular push up.\n\nSo I apply a similar transformation.\nBetween form quality and variations I can get 6 modifiers\n\nNot bad. It’s still simple, but can provide enough variation in the results.\nLet’s put that in a table §\n\nIf all exercises used the same table, then 30 pushups done with Great form and a progress would be the bottom right square (which is 43.2)\nThis means that I’ll have to adjust this table based on what I think the ideal number of reps/seconds are for each individual exercise.\nNormalizing it to a score over 100 §\nI was thinking about how to transform this into a function out of 100.\nI played around with the idea of normal distribution. Since the amount of reps a person can do should fall somewhere within the population distribution. In the end, it didn’t make sense because I don’t think I’m comparing people to their level within the population (?) I’m not sure about this and need to think some more.\nSo I tried a different approach.\nSome things I wanted\n\nI want the bottom right square of the matrix to score 100 (ideal # of reps / ideal form / ideal progression)\nI want the graph to slope up fast and plateau (which is the experience of building a skill)\n\nSo it needs to look something like this.\n\nIn the end, I (arbitrarily) chose a sigmoid function of the form\n\nwhich gives me the shape I want\nI messed around with numbers and I ended up with\n\nwhich starts at 0 and goes up to 100\nI chose for a=0.08 and b=1.05. Unfortunately, those are numbers I also just came up with through trial and error.\nShifting a affects the overall number of reps\nSo for example, if I made a=0.1 then it would take LESS reps to score higher\nconversely, if a=0.01 then you’d need MORE reps to score higher\nShifting b affects the bend in the curve. (i.e. how steep newbie gains are // or how early you plateau)\nIf I made b=1.1 then lower reps would score higher (with a minimal effects on higher reps)\nIf b=1.01 then the graph starts to look more linear\nSo here’s what I end up with\n\nMore Thoughts §\nI think I’d like the formulas to be less arbitrary, but for now I think it works.\nI’d need a unique table per exercise, but it’s a good start to getting a score out of 100 for each of the 6 exercises based on the number of reps they can do.\n\nRead more at: How to balance measureables and actual healthcare\nYou may also be interested in: Data has killed our intuition"},"Notes/My-Virtues":{"title":"My Virtues","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC"],"tags":["-virtues-","-principles-"],"content":"\n“Where attention goes, meaning grows.”\n\nThat means, just by thinking of a virtue, you may just start to live more in line with it.\n\nJoy, Awe, and Wonder: Smile, laugh, grin.

I wonder if that kills it in the first place. Like by designating. Okay, now I’m going to play for the next two hours.

But this art is usually laughably ugly, made by a bot who can generate millions of soulless pieces of art.\n\nAlso, someone could just right click and save a piece of generated art, making the ‘non-fungible’ part questionable. Remember, the NFT is only a receipt, even if the art it links to is generated off an ID in the receipt.\n\n\n\nhowever, NFTs are marketed as if they’re selling you the art itself, which they’re not. This is rightly called out by just about everybody. You can decentralize receipts because those are small and plain-text (inexpensive to log in the blockchain), but that art needs to be hosted somewhere. If the server where art is hosted goes down, your art is gone.\n\n\nNFT minters are often art thieves, minting others’ work and trying to spin a profit. The anonymous nature of NFTs makes it hard to crack down on, and moderation is poor in NFT communities.\n\n\nArtists who get into NFTs with a sincere hope of making money are often hit with a harsh reality that they’re losing more money to minting NFTs of their art is making in profit. (Each individual minted art piece costs about 70−100 USD to mint)\n\n\nmost huge sales are actually the seller selling it to themselves under a different wallet, to try to grift others into thinking the token is worth more than it is. Wallet IDs are not tied to names and therefore are anonymous enough to encourage drumming up fake hype.\n\n\nexample: If you mint a piece of art, that art is worth (technically speaking) zero dollars until someone buys it for a price. That price is what the market dictates is the value of your art piece.\n\n\nSince you’re 70downalreadyandnobody′sbuyingyourart,yougettheideatostartasecondcryptowallet,andpretendit′ssomeoneelse.Yousellyourartpiece(whichwasprovablyworthzerodollars)toyourselfforlike12,000.

Maybe it’s worth more!\n\n\nPoor stranger is now down 14K.Youturned12k and a piece of art worth 0into26K.\n\n\n\n\ncreating artificial scarcity as a design goal, which is very counter to the idea of a free and open web of information. This makes the privatization of the web easier.\n\n\nusing that artificial scarcity to drive a speculation market (hurts most people except hedge funds, grifters, and the extremely lucky)\n\n\nNFTs are driven by hype, making NFT investers/scammers super outspoken and obnoxious. This is why the tone of the conversation around NFTs is so resentful of them, people are sick of being forced to interact with NFT hypebeasts.\n\n\nquestionable legality — haven for money laundering because crypto is largely unregulated and anonymous\n\n\ngamers are angry because game publishers love the idea of using NFTs as a way to squeeze more money out of microtransactions. Buying a digital hat for your character is only worth anything because of artificial scarcity and bragging rights. NFTs bolster both of those\n\n\nThe computational cost of minting NFTs (and verifying blockchain technology on the whole) is very energy intensive, and until our power grids are run with renewables, this means we’re burning more coal, more fossil fuels, so that more grifters can grift artists and investors.\n\n\nHope this explains. You’re correct that the tone is very anti-NFT. Unfortunately the answer is complicated and made of tons of issues. The overall tone you’re detecting is a combination of resentment of all these bullet points.\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Nav-Bhatia-on-the-Hall-of-Fame":{"title":"Nav Bhatia on the Hall of Fame","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nav Bhatia and the hall of fame §\nNav Bhatia\nJoe pomoliano tweet\nWhat a story\nhttps://twitter.com/JoePompliano/status/1395161849818226689"},"Notes/Naval-Space-Battles":{"title":"Naval Space Battles","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/sci-fi","tags/space","tags/naval","tags/battle"],"tags":["idea-note","sci-fi","space","naval","battle"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#sci-fi#space#naval#battle\nurl: https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n05/tom-stevenson/where-are-the-space-arks\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nI like the idea in this essay that space battles will be more like navigating the sea instead of flying\nSo it’s not open space like in whatever show\nIt’s a bit like star wars actually.\nWhere you have to spend time near planets.\nUse them as islands\nAnd then fight in the periphery of it\nSo you have islands.\nLike during the pacific war\nSee also §"},"Notes/Navigating-Humidity--The-Invisible-Barrier-to-Well-Being":{"title":"Navigating Humidity: The Invisible Barrier to Well-Being","links":["Maps/Climate-MOC","Notes/Understand-that-seasons-are-different-in-the-Philippines-(idea-concept)"],"tags":["climate","climate-adaptation","physical-health","self-care","environment","environmental-awareness"],"content":"In places like the Philippines, humidity is more than just an uncomfortable inconvenience; it’s a stealthy adversary to well-being. It sneaks up on you, often undermining your body’s natural cooling mechanisms and putting you at risk for heat-related illnesses. Unlike dry heat, where the rules of engagement are relatively straightforward, humidity necessitates more nuanced strategies.\nThink of humidity as the “rope bridge” of climate challenges—it might not look as daunting as a chasm, but it requires careful and intentional navigation. Living in the Philippines, I often find the humidity to be an invisible wall, affecting not just how I exercise but also how my body recovers and adapts.\nWhen tackling this issue, it’s akin to addressing a complex system where the interventions need to be holistic rather than isolated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer a baseline approach: stay indoors with air conditioning, hydrate, and pace your outdoor activities. However, the key adjustment for humid climates like ours is speeding up “exposure reduction interventions.” Translation: take action faster than you would in a dry climate.\nIf you find yourself outdoors, timing is crucial. Early morning or late evening workouts are advisable to avoid the peak humidity levels that typically occur during midday. For those who have the flexibility, seeking air-conditioned or naturally cooler environments for activities like reading or mindfulness practices can make a considerable difference in overall well-being.\nIt’s not merely about combating humidity; it’s about adapting to it. While the weather might not be within our control, our responses to it are. Navigating the humid labyrinth requires us to be proactive, prepared, and, most importantly, aware. By doing so, we not only protect our health but also improve the quality of our lives in these challenging climates.\n\nRead more at: When Does Humidity Become Dangerous to Your Health?\nGo one level up : Climate MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Understand that seasons are different in the Philippines (idea concept)"},"Notes/Navigating-Through-Life's-Toughest-Chapters":{"title":"Navigating Through Life's Toughest Chapters","links":["Notes/For-Weil,-it-is-the-suffering-that-we-have-an-obligation-to"],"tags":["emotional-maturity","emotional-honesty","resilience","personal-suffering","life"],"content":"On Personal Suffering: The Individual Journey\nIn the solitary moments of suffering, I’ve understood that comparisons do little justice to our personal narratives. Each of us endures hardships with a unique backdrop, and my own trials cannot be diminished by another’s resilience or magnified by their vulnerability. The intensity of my experiences warrants its own stage, devoid of the shadows of others’ stories.\nEmbracing Emotional Integrity: The Courage to Feel\nAcknowledging the heart’s turmoil is not a sign of weakness but a brave act of confrontation. Pinpointing whether I am cradling anger, grief, jealousy, or despair is the first step towards navigating through them. Denying these feelings is like ignoring a wound; it doesn’t prevent the bleeding—it only delays healing and perhaps causes further damage.\nThe Unfiltered Truth: A Pact with Self\nWhen someone reaches out, I owe it to myself to offer honesty. If I am not okay, the world shall hear me say, “I’m struggling,” rather than a hollow “I’m fine.” This transparency is not for the comfort of others but a lifeline thrown into the seas of my own making, a chance for genuine connection and support.\nScars as Testimonies: The Inevitable Exchange\nIn my most contemplative moments, I’ve come to terms with the fundamental truth: the pursuit of anything meaningful is inherently risky. Embracing life’s full spectrum means accepting that scars will decorate my journey. They are not merely reminders of pain but also emblems of courage and the price paid for moments of true value.\n\nRead more at: 63 Steps to Survive the Worst Moments of Your Life\nYou may also be interested in: For Weil, it is the suffering that we have an obligation to"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Curse-of-Knowledge--Crafting-Effective-Introductions":{"title":"Navigating the Curse of Knowledge- Crafting Effective Introductions","links":["Maps/networking-MOC","Notes/Counter-the-bystander-effect-with-a-Directly-Responsible-Individual"],"tags":["communication","startup","knowledge","curse-of-knowledge","messaging"],"content":"Introductions, whether they are in the form of emails, presentations, or conversations, have a crucial role in communication. Yet, it’s all too easy to fall victim to the “curse of knowledge,” a concept famously discussed by C.S. Lewis.\nThis curse occurs when individuals, well-versed in a particular subject, forget that their audience doesn’t share the same level of familiarity. In the realm of startups and business interactions, it’s vital to overcome this cognitive hurdle.\nThe key lies in providing context. A well-crafted introduction should offer enough information about yourself or your startup so that the recipient grasps the purpose and significance of your message. Omitting essential context can lead to confusion and misinterpretation, forcing the recipient to fill in the gaps or, worse, discard your message altogether.\nAdditionally, highlighting what makes your startup unique is a powerful way to pique the recipient’s interest. Clearly articulating your value proposition sets the stage for a more meaningful and engaging interaction.\nMoreover, consider the medium of your introduction. Attachments, such as presentation decks, summaries, or screenshots, can enhance understanding and make your message more compelling.\nIn essence, the art of introductions is about transcending the curse of knowledge. It’s about ensuring that your message is not lost in translation, but rather, it resonates with your audience, inviting them to connect and engage with your ideas and offerings.\n\nRead more at: Introductions and the “forward intro email” | by Roy Bahat | Also by Roy Bahat\nGo one level up : networking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Counter the bystander effect with a Directly Responsible Individual"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Data-Quagmire--The-Paradox-of-Wearable-Tech":{"title":"Navigating the Data Quagmire: The Paradox of Wearable Tech","links":["Maps/Data-MOC","Notes/The-problem-with-tracking-and-wearables"],"tags":["wearables","data-analysis","data","health-coaching","mindfulness"],"content":"Wearable technology, with its flashy dashboards and real-time metrics, promises a utopia of self-knowledge. However, the article “A Framework to Make Better Use of Wearables Data” cracks open the myth of continuous tracking as an unequivocal good. The lure of data can often become a labyrinth, trapping you in an endless cycle of quantification without meaningful context.\nHere’s a hard truth: Optical technology, the backbone of most wearables, isn’t as reliable as we’d like to think. This becomes glaringly apparent when our bodies are in motion. Suddenly, the heart rate monitor acts like a compass in the Bermuda Triangle—wayward, and highly prone to error. For me, this underlines the critical importance of context and timing when interpreting data.\nSo, why the fascination with 24/7 monitoring? Is it genuinely beneficial, or is it a sleight of hand to keep us engaged with the device? Data for the sake of data is an empty endeavor. It’s like obsessing over the metrics of your business without understanding what those numbers actually mean for its health and growth. The notion that wearables offer a holistic view of our wellbeing is an attractive but misleading narrative.\nThe article recommends a more mindful approach—spot checks in the morning or continuous monitoring only during sleep. This method may not shower you with data, but what you do collect is likely more useful. Why? Because it’s data that can be meaningfully interpreted.\nLet’s recalibrate our perspective on wearable tech. Continual monitoring isn’t inherently useful; meaningful data is. Just like in entrepreneurship, it’s not about having all the data but knowing which data matters. It’s about precision, not abundance.\n\nRead more at: A framework to make better use of Wearables data\nGo one level up : Data MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The problem with tracking and wearables"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Gray-Areas-of-Lifestyle-Medicine--A-Balanced-Approach":{"title":"Navigating the Gray Areas of Lifestyle Medicine: A Balanced Approach","links":["Notes/How-to-think-about-dietary-supplements-when-you're-injured"],"tags":["lifestyle-management","lifestyle-medicine","alzheimers","dementia","holistic-health"],"content":"The Supplement Dilemma §\nLifestyle medicine specialists often hesitate to recommend supplements, despite mounting evidence suggesting their benefits. This cautious approach, although understandable given the regulatory issues and potential biases, may sometimes work against patient interests. It’s crucial to recognize that lifestyle interventions and supplements aren’t mutually exclusive. I wholeheartedly believe in using all the tools available, including supplements, to reach our health goals.\nRegulatory and Cost Barriers §\nThese hesitations are further complicated by regulatory issues and the costs associated with accessing supplements and testing. For some, this can be a roadblock, limiting the availability of potential treatment options.\nA Holistic Approach to Alzheimer’s and Dementia §\nThis restrictive mindset is particularly detrimental when considering treatments for conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. We should not limit ourselves to a single avenue of treatment; instead, we should explore all possible options to provide the best care. By doing so, we open up a world of possibilities that go beyond standard prescriptions.\nBeyond Black and White §\nThe key takeaway is that there’s a gray area that should not be ignored. The choices aren’t as binary as they may seem; lifestyle changes and supplements can complement each other. The focus should be on an individualized, balanced approach that doesn’t shy away from exploring a range of therapies and interventions.\nBridging the Gap §\nBy avoiding an ‘either-or’ mindset, we can bridge the gap between traditional and lifestyle medicine. This balanced approach can make a significant difference, especially for chronic conditions that require long-term management. It’s about expanding our toolkit, not limiting it.\n\nRead more at: #257 ‒ Cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and head injuries: mitigation and prevention strategies, supplements, and more | Tommy Wood, M.D., Ph.D. - Peter Attia\nYou may also be interested in: How to think about dietary supplements when you’re injured"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Labyrinth-of-Career-Success":{"title":"Navigating the Labyrinth of Career Success","links":["Notes/On-Radical-Career-Switching"],"tags":["career","career-authenticity","personal-data","self-realization","work-culture","work","work-life-balance"],"content":"Success is a chameleon, often taking on the hues of our workplace culture and societal expectations. In the race for the corner office, it’s easy to chase milestones set by the very environment we compete in—money, titles, the visible markers of ‘making it’. Like Pac-Man, we gobble up these dots along our career path, often without questioning whether the maze we’re in leads to a destination we actually desire.\nBut here I am, trying to carve out a path that is authentically mine, seeking a victory in a game that aligns with my values, not just the high score someone else has set. I reflect on the numerous stories of those who’ve climbed the traditional ladder of success, only to discover it was leaning against the wrong wall. It’s an all-too-common narrative that begs the question: Are we pursuing what truly fulfills us, or are we simply collecting the accolades and affirmations of a game we don’t enjoy?\nIt’s critical to step back and assess the metrics we use to define our own success. Are they monetary, or do they relate to the impact and fulfillment we gain? Do our careers reflect our passions, or are they merely a reflection of societal norms and expectations? As I forge my own path, I’m reminded that success, much like happiness, is deeply personal and cannot be distilled into a universal formula.\nIt’s about finding the balance between personal growth, financial stability, and the joy of the work itself. The conversations I’ve had with those who’ve walked this road, the kayak guides and bankers alike, underscore the diversity of fulfillment in work. Their stories serve as waypoints, guiding me to consider not only the end goal but also the texture and color of the journey itself.\nIn shaping my career, I’m not looking for a map but rather a compass—pointing towards what gives my work meaning beyond the conventional scorecard. The real victory lies not in the accolades I collect but in playing a game that feels like my own—where the measures of success are tailored to my aspirations, where the path I walk is one I’ve chosen, not one chosen for me.\n\nRead more at: Playing a Career Game You Actually Want to Win\nYou may also be interested in: On Radical Career Switching"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Labyrinth-of-Mind-Traps":{"title":"Navigating the Labyrinth of Mind Traps","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/Building-up-your-mental-fitness"],"tags":["cognitive-bias","mindfulness","self-awareness","imposter-syndrome"],"content":"Mind traps can be seen as the “quicksand” of our mental landscapes—treacherous areas where you find yourself sinking in a whirlpool of unproductive thoughts. These traps manifest differently for everyone, but the commonality lies in their ability to distort our perspective, often without us even realizing it.\nWhen you’re navigating this maze, think of yourself as a labyrinth explorer—outfitted not with a sword and shield, but with the weapons of self-awareness and mindfulness. For me, imposter syndrome is one of those traps. It’s like entering a hall of mirrors, where every reflection whispers that I’m not good enough, not “real” enough. This experience can be suffocating, pulling you deeper into the maze.\nThe trick is not merely to identify these traps, but to name them. It’s like a spell that reduces their power. Recognize them as distortions, not as your reality. When I realize I’m under the spell of imposter syndrome, I have to tell myself, “This is not me. This is a distortion of my abilities and worth.”\nConsider the following:\n\nDo you often find yourself looping through the same thoughts, akin to a hamster on a wheel?\nAre you narrowly focusing on elements that are mere fragments of the entire picture, like looking at a forest but only seeing one or two trees?\n\nIdentifying and naming these mind traps is akin to discovering secret passages in the labyrinth, shortcuts that help you escape or, at the very least, mitigate the trap’s effects. It’s crucial, not just for your mental wellbeing, but also for your interpersonal relationships and professional growth.\nIt’s not about eliminating mind traps entirely—that’s as futile as trying to smooth out a crumpled paper to perfection. It’s about recognizing their presence and navigating them strategically, almost like a sailor tacking against the wind. This approach enables you to shift your focus, gain perspective, and move towards a more balanced and self-aware existence.\n\nRead more at: 10 common mind traps and how to break free — Groov | Workplace Mental Wellbeing Platform\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Building up your mental fitness"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Maze-of-Complexity-with-Design-Thinking":{"title":"Navigating the Maze of Complexity with Design Thinking","links":["Notes/Teaching-people-to-use-networked-thinking"],"tags":["design-thinking","problem-solving","wicked-problems","innovation"],"content":"In the realm of problem-solving, design thinking emerges as a beacon of clarity, transforming the intricate into the manageable. It’s a strategic alchemy that distills down the chaos of “wicked problems”—those entangled issues that defy simple definition and resist straightforward solutions. These are the hydra-headed challenges where each solution seems to spawn new questions, making you wonder if you’ve even grasped the root cause.\nIn my journey, I’ve found solace in the orderly process of design thinking. It’s a structured yet flexible framework that doesn’t just confront complexity; it embraces it. Here’s my take: everything morphs into a design-thinking challenge, from the systemic puzzles of education to the deeply personal battle against postpartum depression. It is in this diversity of application where its true power lies.\nHorst Rittel illuminated the path when he spoke of problems so tenacious and complex that they were dubbed “wicked.” These aren’t your garden-variety issues but rather the sort that intertwine with human unpredictability and societal structures. When facing such Goliaths, one learns quickly that the task isn’t to find a silver bullet. Instead, we seek to navigate the labyrinth, to understand that the problem’s definition evolves as we peel back layers, venturing deeper into the ‘why’ behind the ‘what.’\nI often reflect on this during my practice—recognizing that what makes design thinkers valuable isn’t just their employability but their adaptability. They’re the intellectual shapeshifters who can turn their hands to the diverse fabric of real-world issues, making them more employable, yes, but fundamentally, more equipped to enact meaningful change.\nIn this light, I see my environment as a living lab—a space where the design thinking methodology breathes life into static issues, viewing each challenge as an opportunity for growth. The optimism my students harbor is mirrored in my approach; there’s a buoyancy in knowing that each “wicked problem” is a chance to redefine the boundaries of what we think is possible.\n\nRead more at: On Design Thinking | Issue 35 | n+1\nYou may also be interested in: Teaching people to use networked thinking"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Metagame--Lessons-from-Academia-to-Entrepreneurship":{"title":"Navigating the Metagame- Lessons from Academia to Entrepreneurship","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/poem-experience-and-knowledge"],"tags":["academia","entrepreneurship","meta-game","metagame","interaction","discourse"],"content":"In the world of expertise and professional pursuits, there exists a phenomenon known as “The Expert Problem,” as articulated by Nassim Taleb. It’s a situation where experts and meta-experts pass judgment on the work of other experts. Over time, this detachment from the practical realities of a field can lead to corruption and dysfunction. In academic circles, this has manifested as the replication crisis and the often perplexing intricacies of the humanities.\nJavier’s journey provides a compelling case study in this regard. His academic background exposed him to a world rich in intellectual discourse and jargon, where conferences and discussions on the latest trends in the field were commonplace. While this environment had its merits and was undeniably intellectually stimulating, it also raised a fundamental question: “What was he truly accomplishing?”\nThe allure of academia often lies in the cerebral discussions and theoretical explorations, but for someone like Javier, the desire to make a tangible impact in the world tugged at his ambitions. The metagame, with its focus on discussing and opining rather than “doing the job,” left him seeking a more hands-on and results-driven path.\nThis realization led him to entrepreneurship, where the landscape is markedly different. Entrepreneurship is firmly grounded in practicality. It’s about taking action, solving real-world problems, and building something from the ground up. It’s an on-the-ground endeavor that demands tangible results, often in stark contrast to the academic world’s propensity for abstract debates.\nJavier’s transition from academia to entrepreneurship represents a shift from the metagame to the game itself, where action takes precedence over discourse. It’s a testament to his desire to be actively engaged in making a difference and creating a meaningful impact on people’s lives.\n\nRead more at: Beware the Metagame\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: poem experience and knowledge"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Supplement-Haze":{"title":"Navigating the Supplement Haze","links":["Notes/Exercise-is-like-Dietary-supplements"],"tags":["critical-thinking","health-supplements","consumer","evidence-based","evidence"],"content":"In the realm of health and wellness, the supplement industry often treads a fine line between fact and fiction, reminiscent of the elusive promises of historical elixirs. The modern market is saturated with products whose benefits are cloaked in ambiguity, skirting the edge of the scientifically disprovable.\nThrough my own journey, I’ve learned the importance of vigilant research and discernment in this space. The sheer volume of products peddled by influencers and corporations necessitates a critical eye — not all that glitters is gold, after all. Yet, it’s not a call for blanket skepticism. There are indeed jewels among the stones, supplements that genuinely enhance well-being and bolster performance, even in the absence of deficiency.\nI’ve come to understand that the onus is on us, the consumers, to sift through the claims with a rigorous, questioning mindset. It’s essential to embrace the dual role of being both open-minded yet uncompromisingly selective, acknowledging that while some supplements are supported by robust evidence, others are little more than contemporary snake oil.\n\nRead more at: Are all dietary supplements basically snake oil? - Quora\nYou may also be interested in: Exercise is like Dietary supplements"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Transition-from-Athlete-to-Post-Competitive-Life":{"title":"Navigating the Transition from Athlete to Post-Competitive Life","links":["Notes/Post-Competitive-Tips"],"tags":["athletes","life-transitions","career","career-development","motivation","self-identity","acceptance"],"content":"Embracing the Uncertainty After the Finish Line\nI’ve lived through the adrenaline-fueled routine of an athlete – the unwavering commitment to training, the sense that pushing to the point of exhaustion was a rite of passage to success. This was my norm; a world where high expectations and a singular focus created a promise of success that seemed almost guaranteed.\nThe highlight from the discussion on athletes’ transition reflects a shared reality; we love the grind, the clarity of purpose in the athletic arena, and the satisfaction derived from “honest work.” However, as I stepped off the track, that world, where goals were clearly marked and efforts visibly rewarded, didn’t transition with me. The rules changed, and the finish line became a starting point for something unfamiliar.\nThis shift has been significant. As I navigate this new terrain, I find the ingrained discipline and drive from my athletic days are assets, yet the playbook has to be rewritten. The transition is more than a career change; it’s a transformation in identity and motivation. The promise of success is no longer tied to a rigorous training schedule and clear-cut objectives but to the ability to adapt and find fulfillment in new challenges.\nAs a health coach, this understanding shapes how I approach my practice and clients. It’s about building resilience, not just physically but emotionally and professionally. For fellow athletes in transition, and anyone reinventing themselves, it’s crucial to acknowledge the strength in the experiences we’ve had and use that as fuel to power through the ambiguity toward new accomplishments.\n\nRead more at: Cup runneth over - by Max Stoneking - Study &amp; Sport\nYou may also be interested in: Post Competitive Tips"},"Notes/Ness-Labs-Creative-Hour":{"title":"Ness Labs Creative Hour","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How do I feel about being a creator?\nResponsibility\nWhat is the difference between a creator and an artist, a freelancer, an entrepreneur, and an influencer?\nI feel like they are different things on the creator scale.\nI could rank them perhaps?\nLike an artist has the least concern over money\nThen the creator\nand then the freelancer\nand then the entrepreneur\nThe influencer doesn’t seem to really fit in this paradigm.\nI think of myself as both a creator and an entrepreneur\n\nThe creator side is me\n\nIt’s my thoughts and my ideas\nIt’s my experiences\nIt’s how I put my own thoughts together in health\nHow I combine everything together\n\n\nThe entrepreneur side is the business\n\nI think right now there is systems that need to get into place\nLike background stuff to make it cleaner\nsystems and products\nBut it all flows from the creator\n\n\n\nThe creator has ideas,\nand combines his experiences in some really interesting ways.\nand then thinks of things he would like to do\nmake products\nor help people\nThe creator used to be a teacher, and that’s why the creator likes to just go and do things\n\nThe entrepreneur is thinking of systems and building things\n\nWhy do some people want to become a creator, and not others?\nThat’s a good question\nIt’s risky\nI think there was a financial incentive for sure\nI wanted the freedom\nThe ability to be with my wife\nBut when I think about it, it wasn’t so easy\nbecause I wasn’t making enough money anyway\nSo when I reflect on my own experience—\nit’s because of the pandemic\nand the freedom that came with that experience\nthat really allowed me to see how nice it is to balance time at home with work and fulfilling projects\nThis was balance that I’ve never had before.\nMaybe some people are already quite comfortable with work\nand they’ve found the stability- and they’re completely okay with that.\nThere are other ways to be creative— without being a creator.\nI can imagine if you have a stable job, and enough free time, then you can be creative in different ways.\nPeople really do have to express themselves creatively.\nAnd there are so many different ways to do that.\nFor me, because of the nature of my work— it’s not going to be convenient.

Mathematically, this is equivalent to saying that if the net force on an object is zero, then the velocity of the object is constant.\nNewton’s 2nd Law of Motion §\nThe second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force.\nNewton’s 3rd Law of Motion §\nThe third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction:"},"Notes/Nick-Offerman-Quote-on-Hot-ones":{"title":"Nick Offerman Quote on Hot ones","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nick Offerman on fixing things §\nSource §\n\nNick Offerman on Hot Ones\n\nQuote §\nPeople who can fix things are better members of their community"},"Notes/Nick-Winkelman":{"title":"Nick Winkelman","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nick Winkelman §"},"Notes/Nicola-McDermott":{"title":"Nicola McDermott","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://youtu.be/jXhIe_M6Rv0?t=8300\nTakes Notes while it’s super fresh\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/20/i-do-sport-but-its-not-who-i-am-nicola-mcdermott-jumping-for-gold-and-god-in-tokyo\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/07/nicola-mcdermott-australia-high-jump-silver-medal-tokyo-2020-olympic-games"},"Notes/Nicolas-Cole-Office-Hours":{"title":"Nicolas Cole Office Hours","links":["Nicolas-Cole","tags/talks"],"tags":["talks"],"content":"Nicolas Cole Office Hours §\nMetadata §\n\nAuthor: Nicolas Cole\nLink: https://youtu.be/VLdXXTjA-TM\nCategory:#talks\n\nHighlights §\n\nDifferent platforms works differently\n\nIt depends on their algorithms\n\n\nQuora is an interesting way of approaching this\n"},"Notes/Nina-Simone-(kit)":{"title":"Nina Simone (kit)","links":["Music-MOC","tags/on/people","1962---Sinnerman-(song)"],"tags":["on/people"],"content":"up:: Music MOC (not included in the LYT Kit)\ntags::#on/people\ndates:: 1933 - 2003\nNina Simone §\nI absolutely love Nina Simone’s song 1962 - Sinnerman (song). It’s in my top 100.\nWiki §\n\nEunice Kathleen Waymon (February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003), known professionally as Nina Simone, was an American singer, songwriter, musician, arranger, and civil rights activist. Her music spanned styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&amp;B, gospel and pop.\nThe sixth of eight children born to a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well received audition, which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree.To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to “Nina Simone” to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play “the devil’s music” or so-called “cocktail piano”. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with “I Loves You, Porgy”. Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.\nWikipedia\n"},"Notes/Nine-Trends-That-Will-Shape-Our-Careers-in-2021":{"title":"Nine Trends That Will Shape Our Careers in 2021","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nine Trends That Will Shape Our Careers in 2021 §\nSource: §\n\nhttps://junglegym.substack.com/p/nine-trends-that-will-shape-our-careers-in-2021\n\nKey Ideas: §\n\nWellness culture is going to be very important\n- Over the past year, organizations across every industry have started thinking about how to promote employee well-being.\n"},"Notes/No-Child-Left-Behind-(Example)":{"title":"No Child Left Behind (Example)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"No Child Left Behind (example) §\nThe problems of\nStandardised Testing\nYou attach funding to results\nYou’re going to see people mess up the results.\nSee also §\nGoodhart’s Law"},"Notes/No-history-no-gratitude-are-fascists":{"title":"No history no gratitude are fascists","links":["Notes/The-masses-are-the-spoiled-child-of-modern-democracy"],"tags":["-history-on/democracy-fascism-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nPhilosophize This\nRevolt of the Masses\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62b9603162ce94f7a90e5d64\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThey have no sense of history\nWeild technology that took years to produce\nwithout appreciation of where it comes from\nThese people resemble fascists\nSee also §\nLouis CK on airplanes\nThe masses are the spoiled child of modern democracy"},"Notes/No-you're-not-lazy--life-is-really-hard":{"title":"No you're not lazy- life is really hard","links":["Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/Setting-motivation-For-lifelong-goals","tags/motivation","tags/on/challenge","Notes/imperfect-motivation"],"tags":["motivation","on/challenge"],"content":"up:: Health MOC\nX:: Setting motivation For lifelong goals\ntags::#motivation#on/challenge\nnovelty:: 3\nLink to Reference §\nurl: No Motivation To Do Anything?

They’re either exercising everyday—or they’re not exercising at all. They’re eating whole foods 100% of the time—or just not bothering. (View Highlight)\nTo support fitness and nutrition habits—especially during major life upheavals—you need solid sleep, stress management, and recovery (View Highlight)\nThat’s interesting because it’s so easy to get caught up in perfectionism, in making sure you do things 100% correctly. You’re always relying on willpower to get things done. But at the end of the day, it’s more your systems that carry you through the day\nThat reminds me of imperfect motivation\nIt’s similar because if the goal is to keep moving and not skip, you take what you can and you build your systems.

It’s a bit like a fractal, where anxiety produces more anxiety in a never-ending cycle.\nHerein lies a paradox: we can become caretakers of our anxieties, so much so that we create an environment for them to flourish. While this may sound counterintuitive, acknowledging our anxieties as an integral part of us could be the first step in managing them.

But this instinct can often do more harm than good in the long run.\nWhen we tense up to protect an injury, we’re preventing our body from full healing. The muscles and tissues around the injury tighten up, which can lead to further damage and pain. \nThis isn’t only true of the body- it’s true of the mind as well.\nThis is Anne Lamott’s quote:\n“Our psychic muscles can cramp around our wounds- the pain from our childhood, the losses and disappointments of adulthood, the humiliations suffered in both- to keep us from getting hurt in the same place again, to keep foreign substances out. So these wounds never have a chance to heal.”\nAnd a physical injury- pulling a muscle- breaking a bone- tearing a ligament is like that. \nThere is physical hurt which we tense up and over protect. But there’s also mental hurt, which makes us over anxious, too careful, and prone to avoidance.\n–\nFear fear everywhere\nThe modern world makes this problem even worse.\nAll around us is a world that makes you feel more and more afraid.\nI don’t know what it is, but it feels like the world has become a scarier and harsher place. It feels like I’m always worried, anxious, and afraid about something. My body is in a perpetual fight or flight mode.\nMaybe it’s the news, maybe it’s social media, I don’t know for sure.\nBut it’s exhausting and it takes a toll on my mental and physical health. \nI’m not the only one feeling this way. \nAccording to a recently study anxiety and depression are on the rise. One that shocked me was that anger was on the rise too! People are more hot-headed than they used to be.\nWhatever the reason, it’s clear that it affects our mind. And that affects our bodies and its ability to recover too.\n–\nLet me share a quick story with you.\nWhen I was a teenager, I injured my shoulder on the trampoline. I used to be a fearless daredevil. That day, I wanted to try a new trick on the trampoline. I did a risky flip, missed the landing, fell off and dislocated my shoulder.\nMy mind didn’t help me then. (Remember pain has its place)\nBut since then, I’m always worried for my shoulders since then. I never found the same confidence and I would avoid moving it. \nI wore protective braces. I held back all the time.\nWhat finally got me feeling safe was talking to a coach. He saw me holding back and said “Hey, you saw your doctor. You did your exercises. You are okay! Don’t let you mind hold you back.”\nAnd he’s right, I’m doing the right exercises, I shouldn’t move as if I was afraid.\nThat did a lot to dispel the fear and uncertainty.\nBut it was easier said than done.\nMy coach helped me intercept the fear, because in my own head I was running away with it- and it was taking me to a bad place.\n–\nWhat I learned there is that on my own, I can get stuck in fear and uncertainty. I needed someone else- like a coach, a doctor, or a mentor- to reassure that things were okay.\nThat’s my secret to all the fear around us.\nSociety now always makes us feel afraid. 24/7 news. Natural disasters. Googling your symptoms. Information Overload. Constant notifications.\nSo it’s no surprise that our minds are always on fight or flight mode.\nAnd to tell you the truth, this affects your body too. The mind affects the body.\nSo what can we do about it? How can we deal with the fear?\nMy first step is to find ways to intercept the fear- and cut it off.\n–\nWhen you are trying to recover from your injuries, and get back into action, you need to intercept your fears. \nOur first instinct tends to be more information. We believe that if we have the right knowledge, we won’t be so afraid. And while that is true, it doesn’t help as much as me think.\nWhat is more effective is to take action.\nAnd I want to do a simple activity with you to take one small step.\nIf you’ll indulge me now- whatever you’re doing, if you’re listening to this while at work, or on the move- if you can take 1 minute to set things aside and be with me here.\nWe’ll do a quick exercise to accept that fear as an emotion.\n(What is the feeling: I’ll never feel better again)\nTake 5 deep breaths and feel your fear.\nIf it helps, project yourself feeling afraid on a movie screen in your mind. See yourself feeling afraid.\nAfter that scene plays out, now imagine yourself taking action, and being brave with your body. What might that look like right now?\nThis doesn’t mean that you have to like your fears or that you have to stay in fight or flight mode all the time. But it does mean that you can acknowledge your fears as a feeling. And then after that- choose to focus on recovery.\nRemember that when we are trying to recover from an injury, our bodies can get stuck in fight or flight mode.\nSo instead of trying to fight our fears, we need to accept and intercept them. §\nRemember, recovering from injury is about improving your health and quality of life.\nYou’re not trying to force yourself or put yourself in danger.\nIf you imagine some action you can take today that makes you feel a bit braver and less afraid- give it a go.\nYou don’t have to avoid all physical activity. But always be mindful of the risks involved and use this exercise to manage it well.\nThe key is to find an activity that you enjoy to help you manage how you feel about it.**"},"Notes/Overcoming-Imposter-Syndrome":{"title":"Overcoming Imposter Syndrome","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/On-Imposter-Syndrome"],"tags":["-imposter-syndrome-","-mission-","-vocation","-work"],"content":"Seth Godin’s ideas on being an imposter\n\n“You feel that way because you are an imposter.

But having seen the impact on two of my clients, I find myself questioning this rosy narrative. While the headlines are busy idolizing Ozempic as the magic pill for fitting into a Met Gala gown, the other side of the story — the potential negative effects on one’s well-being — is often sidelined.\nThe buzz surrounding Kim Kardashian and her speculated use of Ozempic to fit into Marilyn Monroe’s dress is intriguing, but the reality may be darker. Articles like “You May Go Through Hell for Your Post-Ozempic Body” from The Cut serve as a chilling reminder that all that glitters is not gold.\nFrom my perspective, it’s concerning to see how quickly people have jumped onto the Ozempic bandwagon without fully grasping its long-term consequences. My clients’ experiences with it were far from satisfactory. It’s as if we’ve traded thoughtful, holistic health approaches for a quick fix, unaware or unwilling to acknowledge the potential toll it can exact on our bodies.\nTo me, it’s not just about questioning the efficacy of these drugs but also challenging the ethics behind their rapid adoption and glamorization. Are we ignoring a critical dialogue about the repercussions in our pursuit of societal beauty and health standards? This is a conversation that I believe needs to be had, especially in the health and fitness community.\n10 Charts That Capture How the World Is Changing\n\nRead more at: Ozempic Side Effects: What it’s Like\nYou may also be interested in: Some thoughts on Ozempic"},"Notes/PARA-framework-of-Tiago-Forte":{"title":"PARA framework of Tiago Forte","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"PARA framework of Tiago Forte §\nSource §\nKey Ideas §\n\nThis is how Tiago manages his knowledge\nIt’s:\n\nProjects\nAreas\nResources and\nArchives\n\n\n"},"Notes/PLDT-Account-Number":{"title":"PLDT Account Number","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"**\nPLDT Home\nLandline: 04 9545 7296\nAccount Number: 0286413706\n**"},"Notes/PN-Coaching-Precision-Nutrition-in-the-Philippines":{"title":"PN Coaching Precision Nutrition in the Philippines","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Franco Madrid\nhttps://taplink.cc/franco_madrid\nWillord Capulong\nhttps://willordcapulong.com/\nFrederick Mark Miano\nhttps://markmiano.issacertifiedtrainer.com/\nMean Jenelle Yabut-Montalvo\nhttps://www.ptdistinction.com/goodfeelsph"},"Notes/Packing-your-bag":{"title":"Packing your bag","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Packing your bag\nHealth toolkit"},"Notes/Pahiyas-festival-and-our-seasons-are-different":{"title":"Pahiyas festival and our seasons are different","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Pahiyas festival §\n(Our Seasons are different)\nIt’s all on May 15 though\nAlong with the similar\nAgawan Festival  and\nAraña’t Baluarte Festival in Sariaya and\nGumaca respectively,\nthese harvest festivals honour San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers.\nThat means our harvest festivals are in May 15\nThat’s the general end of the growing season\nSource:\nhttps://thesmartlocal.com/read/philippines-harvest-festivals/#:~:text=Every%20May%2015,%20the%20country’s,the%20patron%20saint%20of%20farmers."},"Notes/Pain-Education":{"title":"Pain Education","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"http://www.pain-ed.com/healthcare-professionals/cognitive-functional-therapy-publications/"},"Notes/Pain-and-Client-Education":{"title":"Pain and Client Education","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://toddhargrove.substack.com/p/kieran-osullivan-on-pain-and-client §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Pain-and-The-Social-Experience":{"title":"Pain and The Social Experience","links":["Maps/Chronic-Pain-MOC","tags/output/youtube","tags/pain"],"tags":["output/youtube","pain"],"content":"up:: Chronic Pain MOC\ntags:: #output/youtube☑️#pain\nrank:: 3\nOutputs:\n**\nPain and injury is a social experience.\nImagine a little kid at the playground running around. They’re chasing after some birds and suddenly they trip and fall flat. Do you what most kids will do before reacting? They’ll look for the mom or dad and try to read their face.\nIt’s so interesting! Instead of reacting to the pain, they look for their parents for information. \nIf their parents look worried and afraid, and rush over to the kid saying “OMG, are you okay? That was so bad!” Then the kid will start crying, and they’ll link the falling down to something bad and negative.\nBut if their parents look calm, and say “Hey buddy, that’s okay- you’re alright.” The pain is still there, but it’s not something scary and worrying. That kid might even get up and keep playing.\nThe parents’ response to their child’s fall affects how the child will understand pain. \nThat means pain is also learned in a contextual kind of way.\nWe think of pain as an isolated physical experience. It’s about how it feels in my body. But pain is also a social experience. How we interact with people when we’re in pain affects our recovery.\nThis might sound weird but pain is something that we learn.\nWe learn how to respond to pain, both emotionally and physically, from the people around us. \nWhen we’re young, we learn about pain from our parents. We see how they react to our injuries, and we learn how to react to pain from their example.\nPain is a social experience, and it’s one that we learn from the people around us.\nAnd we continue to learn about pain throughout our lives. \n–\nLet me tell you a story about two different doctors.\nIt was 2010 when I tore my ACL playing basketball. I was so afraid that was it for me. I had hurt myself, and I would never be as strong again. I went in to see a doctor, who told me that I needed surgery. So I agreed, I went into it. When I woke up from surgery the doctor told me:\n“Hey you’re up- The surgery was great, your knee is now better than new.”\nI was so relieved and grateful. And I went on to get back to my sports and hobbies.\nIt’s been 10 years since my injury, and I’m still playing sports and enjoying my activities. \nI’m so grateful to the doctor who helped me get better and gave me the confidence to move again.\nNow for Doctor #2, \nAt the start of 2020, the year of covid, I started having some nerve pain going down my arm. This was a new and unfamiliar injury, so I wanted to make sure it was nothing serious.\nLike last time, I went to see a doctor. She did some tests and then told me:\n“You’ve got a pinched nerve. We can treat it, but it’s also going to keep coming back again and again and again.”\nThat was not reassuring, and actually quite scary. I didn’t know what I could do.\nAnd it turned out to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. \nI got more worried, more stressed, and more anxious. That made my body more tense and tight. Which made my nerve pain worse!\nToday, in 2022, I’ve learned a lot about pain since then. And while I know I can work on my mindset to deal with it- I had to suffer a lot of fear, worry, and anxiety- which made my pain worse\nThe doctor’s words put in my mind a broken and irreparable body- and that has sunk into my subconscious.\nIt’s only in the last year that I’m learning that I can deal with it well.\nAnd that’s what I’m doing now. I’m still living with some nerve pain, but I’m also practicing the right mindset.\nI’m doing things that make me happy, and I’m surrounded by people who support me in that journey.\nIf you’re stuck in an injury, I hope these stories give you something to think about.\n–\nA key factor in successful recovery from injury is having someone you can trust. It may be a doctor, coach, spouse, or friend.\nIn simple words, it is having someone in your corner who understands your challenges. You feel comfortable sharing about your recovery. You trust that they will help you through it.\nIt’s someone who will be there for you when you need support and who will help you stay on track when things get tough.\nThere’s a term in recovery called the “therapeutic alliance”\nThis is a special bond that forms between a coach, or a doctor and client. It’s based on trust, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to your recovery. \nResearch has shown that the quality of the therapeutic alliance is one of the most important predictors of successful treatment outcomes.\nIn other words, finding a doctor or coach that you can trust and who has a strong therapeutic alliance with you is a big part of the recovery process. \nSo if you’re looking for someone to help you on your journey to recovery, make sure to find someone who meets these criteria.\n—\nRemember, pain is a social experience. That means the people around you do have a big impact on your health.\nIf your family and friends are always worried for your injury- and they keep telling you to take it easy and to not move around. This can reinforce the subconscious belief that you’re not supposed to move at all.\nThat can keep you stuck in an injury mindset and make it harder for you to recover.\nBut if the people around you are supportive and don’t act worried, it can make a big difference. They help you believe that your recovery is on track, and that you can trust your body again.\nThey can help you stay positive and motivated. It reminds you that you’re capable of overcoming this hurdle.\nSo if you’re stuck in an injury, don’t isolate yourself. \nMake sure you’re surrounded by people who understand what you’re going through and who can offer you the right environment to get through it.\n–\nGive this time, and start to explore.\nTrust is not something that comes right away.\nYou’re always looking for someone who knows what you’ve been through. They may have seen many patients. They may have gone through an injury themselves.\nFinding someone who understands can be a challenge.\nBut it’s not impossible.\nYou might already have people in mind when it comes to trust. They might not be doctors or physical therapists, but remember! It is just as important to feel safe, calm, and trusting. There may already be people in your life like that.\n–\n**"},"Notes/Pain-can-set-at-a-different-threshold":{"title":"Pain can set at a different threshold","links":["Notes/Pain-is-Complex"],"tags":[],"content":"Pain can set at a different threshold §\nThe idea that stuck to me here is having a different threshold.\nOr when it normalizes, it goes back to a different level\nThen you have to learn to live and adapt with that pain\nSource: GMB Alpha Pain is Complex"},"Notes/Pain-is-Complex":{"title":"Pain is Complex","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Pain is very complex §\nSource §\nGMB Alpha (Jarlo on Pain)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XdxC5F5XgfNfxrEuK889DJgfJxxGBGFp/view?usp=sharing"},"Notes/PainAcademy.net-Market-Research":{"title":"PainAcademy.net Market Research","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","tags/business","Peter-Crone","Rosie-Harriott"],"tags":["business"],"content":"up:: Entrepreneurship MOC\nX::\ntags::#business\nnovelty:: 3\nContext / Source §\nurl: Pain Assessment Toolkit v2w - Pain Academy\nKey Ideas §\nThat’s interesting because it looks a lot like what I’m trying to do.

As far as I can tell, it’s the only major study on the topic.\n\nIn the study,\n(1) they asked participants to rate how they slept the night before\n(2) gave them a quick 5-minute lesson on sleep and REM cycles\nthen the placebo part:\n(3) Hooked them up to machine (that does nothing), “measured” their sleep, and then told them their previous night’s rest was just what they needed\nIn the experiment, the belief that you got enough sleep was enough to boost cognitive performance as if you had actually slept well the night before.\nMy 2 big takeaways from the study §\n#1 Education about how the body works plays a big part in health.\nThe days when coaches and doctors could just talk down to their patients are gone.\nI learned this firsthand when I was experiencing chronic pain. The first step on my path to recovery was educating myself on how pain works (4min). Through that I became less anxious and fearful, and I could take care of my health better\nWhen it comes to health- teaching someone how their body works is important. And communicating it well is a skill that coaches need to learn.\n#2 Relying on ‘objective’ trackers can backfire. There’s merit to subjective measurement\nIn the past, I was obsessed with tracking my sleep data on my smartwatch.\nSome days, I would wake up feeling good, but my watch would tell me that I didn’t sleep enough. Then everything would backfire. I would get anxious. I would second guess my sleep. I would worry about making it up the next night.\nBy focusing on your overall sleep experience (1min) and not just the data, you can improve the quality of your sleep and feel more rested when you get up in the mornin\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/Plant-Dormancy":{"title":"Plant Dormancy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Plant Dormancy §\nDrought can trigger this\nSo I think here the hot season would make them dormant\nIt’s hard with the literature here.\nI just have to observe and make notes\n—\nI think plant dormancy here is around the summer\nwhen things are too hot"},"Notes/Plant-craze-is-not-good":{"title":"Plant craze is not good","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Source: §\n\nhttps://www.rappler.com/moveph/plant-craze-puts-mount-busa-orchids-risk-biologist-warns\n"},"Notes/Plants-need-air":{"title":"Plants need air","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Plants need air. §\nI overcrowded them so much\nI really need to let plants air\nI had a lot of fear about maximizing my yield but in effect I overcrowded my plants"},"Notes/Plastic-Recylcing-Local-Phlippines":{"title":"Plastic Recylcing Local Phlippines","links":[],"tags":["-recycling-plastic-"],"content":"https://sentinelupcycling.com.ph/"},"Notes/Plato's-Cave":{"title":"Plato's Cave","links":["Maps/Philosophy-MOC-(kit)","tags/note/develop","Plato","Copernicus","Gallileo","Jesus","Notes/Sense-of-Control","Notes/Dimensions-of-Reality","1884---Flatland"],"tags":["note/develop"],"content":"up:: Philosophy MOC (kit)\ntags::#note/develop🍃\npeople:: Plato\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nContent and links have been removed.\n\n\nPlato’s Cave §\nWhen you return and tell everyone their beliefs are wrong…What happens is the same thing that happened to Copernicus and Gallileo and Jesus and… They don’t like that because they lose a Sense of Control.\nI relate this to Dimensions of Reality, in which our friend “A Square” from 1884 - Flatland faces a similar predicament."},"Notes/Play-(Book-Outline)":{"title":"Play (Book Outline)","links":["Stuart-Brown-M.D.","Christopher-Vaughan","tags/on/books"],"tags":["on/books"],"content":"Play (Book Outline) §\n\nMetadata §\n\nAuthor: Stuart Brown M.D. and Christopher Vaughan\nFull Title: Play: How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Sou\nCategory:#on/books\n\nHighlights §\n\n\n"},"Notes/Play-Involves-Risk":{"title":"Play Involves Risk","links":["Maps/Movement-MOC","Notes/Play-as-a-consequence-free-environment"],"tags":["-play-","-risk-","-injury-","-fear-"],"content":"It’s impossible to play without risking injury.\nThe important thing is to figure out ways to fail safely.\nI tweeted about this here: Javier Luis Gomez 🚶‍♂️ on X: “One of the key features of play is that it involves (controlled) risk Remember when you were a kid and you would explore?

I think it’s about the mindset you have §\nSometimes when I’m going on a long walk, I have a lot on my mind. Even though I think of hiking as play, if I’m in a place of stress and anxiety, it doesn’t feel relaxing. It feels like a chore.\nI’ve definitely gone on hikes where I was just putting one foot in front of the other and NOT enjoying myself at all.\nOn the other hand, I’ve been at the gym where I’m so present and in the zone. I am aware of each movement. I start noticing my body and muscles in ways I did not before. I start to feel relaxed and curious.\nThat definitely is play for to me.\nOther times, when I’m at the gym- I’m so present and completely aware of each of my movements. I start noticing things in my muscles that I didn’t before. I feel present and curious!\nThat’s more like play.\nEvery movement, every activity can be play- if you bring the right attention to it.\nThe 3 ways that I practice play §\nWhen was the last time you moved because you wanted to? Just for its own sake?\nWe can get caught up in the benefits of exercise, that it starts to feel like a chore- and not something that I want to do.\nHow can I make a movement playful more myself?\n1. Setting aside play time §\nThe best way to give my mind the space to play is to commit to a set time.\nIt can be 15 minutes, it can be 1 hour. Either way, I tell myself\n“These 15 minutes are just to play. No phones. No work. Nothing else but this”\nThat way when I’m playing, I get to be fully present. I’m not really worried about what I need to do next- or where I have to go. I can just set a timer, start playing and just immerse myself in it.\nAnd when the alarm sounds I can go back to my work\n2. ‘Sensing’ my Activity §\nMy mind is always racing around- thinking about what needs to be done next.\nSo I practice play by trying to sense everything there is about my activity.\nIf I’m lifting weights, I might ask:\n“How do the weights feel in my hand?”\n“What textures do I notice on the gym equipment?”\nIf I’m going for swim, I’ll notice:\n“Is the water hot or cold?”\n“What do I taste when I’m immersed?”\n“What sounds do I notice when I’m underwater?”\nThese kinds of questions snap me back to what I’m doing. And it helps me get into a play state of mind.\n3. Using Creativity and Curiosity §\nI also like to mess around. (As long as I know it’s safe)\nWhen I’m playing, I’ll build on what I’m sensing and I’ll see what I can change.\nFor example, if I’m hiking I might say:\n“What if I close my eyes for a few seconds”\n“What if I walk backwards? What if I add a little skip to my step?”\n“What if I notice the unevenness of the ground?”\nIf I’m doing pushups, I might try:\n“What if I position my hands differently?&quot;&quot;\n“Can I do it? Does it feel safe? Does it change the exercise?”\n“Is it easier or harder? What am I learning about my body?”\nThese little things keep my mind in the zone. And let me discover new things about my body or my environment. It’s not just the same each time.\n\nRead more at: URL\nGo one level up : Health Mindsets MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Play, Movement, and Morality"},"Notes/Play-mind-does-different-things-than-the-productive-mind":{"title":"Play mind does different things than the productive mind","links":["Notes/My-experience-of-play"],"tags":[],"content":"Play mind does different things than the productive mind §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea §\n\nIn companies you have to protect your play mind from your productive mind\nIf you’re exploring, you have to stop yourself from feeling too critical.\nIf you’re always editing yourself, you won’t be able to just be creative.\nProtect your play mind from your productive mind.\n\nSee also §\nMy experience of play"},"Notes/Play-vs-a-game":{"title":"Play vs a game","links":["Notes/Games-that-let-you-explore"],"tags":["-on/play-game-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nJarlo Ilano\nBetter movement podcast\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62a199063f707348d6175b02\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nReasons for play\nParkour and play\nPlay is\nA game vs play\nA game is about winning and trying to succeed\nand play is for the sake of\nSee also §\nGames that let you explore"},"Notes/Play-works-a-lot-to-build-elite-athletes":{"title":"Play works a lot to build elite athletes","links":["Notes/Post-Athlete-life-almost-always-reverts-to-mean"],"tags":["-track-and-field-athletics-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nDavid Epstein\nI Object to “Gladwell’s Law”\nurl: https://davidepstein.bulletin.com/my-take-on-gladwell-s-law-that-elite-athletic-achievement-comes-at-the-expense-of-mass-participation/\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nso I feel obliged to point out that the Jamaican sprint factory is powered by youth “sports days” at school where literally everyone tries sprinting in an atmosphere geared toward fun.

All I knew was how to push my body to its limit. Let’s just say that got my into more injuries than I’d like to admit.\nThese days, I have a few rules for myself when it comes to staying healthy. It’s helped me transition into my post-competitive life better.\n1. It’s okay to do the bare minimum §\nSome days are just so busy. And as much as I would love to have time to go on long runs or hit up the gym, I just can’t. So I’m practicing establishing a minimum workout. And then not feeling so guilty when I have to resort to that.\n2. Sneak in more activity §\nAnother trick I like is finding ways to get a little bit more physical activity throughout the day. Standing desk is the classic example of this. My personal fave is using a basket instead of a cart when grocery shopping. (I gotta carry it around + I end up buying less).\n3. Stop Comparing Myself to Myself §\nMaybe the hardest one for me, but I find I’m always thinking back to how fit I used to be back then.

To have enough money that they can stop thinking about it and focus on other stuff.

Frugality and savings become such a big part of some people’s identity that they can’t ever switch gears. (View Highlight)\nThat’s interesting because I think about health also and how people think health is for its own sake. But you have to learn how to spend your health too.\nSo you have certain windows and opportunities.\nBoth to spend your money and to move your body\nBecause at some point it just doesn’t really become possible anymore.\nSo for example, for me, I hike when I can. I want to work and farm because my body is able to do that now. It’s not a project that I can do when I retire. It’s something that I can do now, and so I should build my life around my ability to do so.\nThat reminds me of Financial wealth is just as important as physical health\nIt’s similar because it’s the same.

How much have you been engaged and focused and what you’re doing, right, right before we pinged you?\nSo stop wishing things are different.

An article titled “3 Musts Before Hiking” opened my eyes to a nuance I’d overlooked—the necessity of pre-hydration. It’s not just about the water you carry; it’s about the hydration you build up days in advance. It seems the journey to the peak starts with a glass of water in hand, long before the trailhead is in sight.\nStudies are emphatic on this: Dehydration is a stealthy saboteur of vigor. Begin hydrating a day or two ahead, allowing water to become your preliminary trail companion, not merely a checkpoint necessity. And alcohol? It’s a false friend when peaks are on the horizon. Who knew that the real trek began with foresight and a filled water bottle at home?\nThis preparation isn’t a cumbersome chore; it’s an act of respect for the body’s needs and the challenges it will face.

There’s something inherently fascinating about going back to basics, especially in our digitally saturated era. One striking example of this is the spark gap radio transmitter. It’s the most rudimentary form of a transmitter, yet its simplicity makes it robust and reliable.\nAccording to the article, “Let’s Say You’ve Gone Back in Time – Fixed,” the spark gap radio transmitter operates on straightforward principles. However, the piece reminds me that even basic technologies carry the essence of ingenuity and problem-solving that our ancestors put forth. These are the rudiments that enabled communication over long distances, far before our modern conveniences.\nIt’s not merely an exercise in nostalgia, but one in self-reliance and ingenuity. If I ever find myself in a situation where modern amenities fail, it’s comforting to know that there are age-old techniques that can still prove effective.\nAs we amass an ever-growing arsenal of advanced technologies, let’s not forget the roots from which we grew. Storing this knowledge for posterity, much like saving seeds for future generations, is an investment in resilience and adaptability. Therefore, simple knowledge like building a spark gap radio transmitter doesn’t just belong in the past; it deserves a space in our present for the sake of an uncertain future.\n\nRead more at: Let’s say you’ve gone back in time – Fixed* – RebuildingCivilization.com\nYou may also be interested in: History is the laboratory of experiences"},"Notes/Presidents-and-Food":{"title":"Presidents and Food","links":["Notes/The-shock-to-food-systems","Notes/The-real-price-of-food","Notes/Society-of-the-Spectacle","Food-MOC","Notes/Food-security-and-developing-countries"],"tags":["-food-","-food-systems-"],"content":"Food policy is not something American presidents have had to give much thought to, at least since the Nixon administration\nNote: This is a great (very long) article on food systems and how it should be thought of on a national scale\nThat’s interesting because I do think feeding our society cannot be a grassroots thing.

The study suggests that by focusing on these variables, we could potentially reduce the majority of risk factors for a range of health conditions. This aligns strongly with my belief: lifestyle management should always be our starting point.\nA Closer Look at Home-Assisting §\nManaging home-assisting levels specifically through methylated B vitamins could be a game-changer. These vitamins are capable of bringing home-assisting levels down to eight or nine, below the lab reference range for normal levels. This means that we can be more targeted in our preventative measures.\nCardiovascular Health: A Case in Point §\nHome-assisting plays a nuanced role in cardiovascular health. The impairment in the clearance of specific molecules shows how crucial it is to keep tabs on home-assisting levels. This opens a new avenue in cardiovascular risk management that goes beyond traditional measures like controlling blood pressure or cholesterol levels.\nThe Nuts and Bolts §\nWhat’s most intriguing is how tailored our approach to risk management can be. The utilization of methylated B vitamins for managing home-assisting levels represents a microcosm of the possibilities. It underlines the need to use scientific advancements to hone our lifestyle choices and make them as precise as possible.\nBridging The Gap §\nBy understanding and leveraging these findings, we can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. The health implications are significant, particularly when it comes to cardiovascular health, an area that can benefit hugely from preventative lifestyle interventions.\n\nRead more at: #257 ‒ Cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and head injuries: mitigation and prevention strategies, supplements, and more | Tommy Wood, M.D., Ph.D. - Peter Attia\nYou may also be interested in: Effect of Wearable Technology Combined With a Lifestyle Intervention on Long-term Weight Loss"},"Notes/Price-Discrimination":{"title":"Price Discrimination","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\n\n\nPrice discrimination and how when something is more expensive people find it more valuable\n\n\nUseful for me in the context of how to price my work\n\n\nSee also §"},"Notes/Pricing-a-digital-product-by-Arlan":{"title":"Pricing a digital product by Arlan","links":[],"tags":["-pricing-business-launch-startup--"],"content":"url: https://twitter.com/ArlanWasHere/status/1535983935716474884\nl just made 20,000in5daysfromadigitalproductIsoldforaslowas∗1.

This condition, often overlooked, can affect various populations, including pregnant and postpartum women, among others. While doctors frequently recommend this test, people may bypass it due to lack of awareness or the expense involved in private lab testing.\nCatching It Early\nEspecially in sensitive life stages like pregnancy or postpartum, an early diagnosis can be crucial. When my wife was pregnant, we found it important to catch any signs of anemia as soon as possible. Early intervention can help manage the condition better and even prevent more severe health outcomes.\nAccessibility and Cost\nThe test for anemia can be conducted by a healthcare provider or, alternatively, at a private lab. However, private labs can often be expensive. Knowing this, it might be a good strategy to discuss this during regular check-ups with your healthcare provider, so you don’t miss out due to cost constraints.\nWho Should Get Tested\nWhile it’s particularly important for those in sensitive life stages, like pregnancy or postpartum, to get tested, anemia can affect anyone. Therefore, asking your doctor to include this test as part of your regular health check-up can be a proactive step.\nWhy This Matters\nAnemia is not just a temporary condition that affects your energy levels; it has far-reaching impacts on your health. It’s better to be proactive and catch it early rather than deal with potential complications later on.\n\nRead more at: Why You Should Test for Anemia - by Emily Oster\nYou may also be interested in: Resources for Biomarkers"},"Notes/Problems-are-good-things.-Reward-it":{"title":"Problems are good things.

It posits that an AI can possess high levels of intelligence while being directed towards any goal, no matter how trivial or profound. This would imply, hypothetically, that a mind surpassing Einstein’s could be singularly focused on something as mundane as manufacturing paperclips.\nAs I ponder over this, I find that the ‘Pretty Large Angle Thesis’ may be a more palatable proposition. It suggests that there’s a significant, though not orthogonal, relationship between an AI’s intelligence and its goals. Can a truly advanced AI, capable of surpassing human intellect, really be indifferent to the purpose for which it’s applied? Or does high intelligence naturally gravitate towards complex, meaningful objectives?\nMy musings lead me to consider that perhaps, as with humans, the direction of an AI’s intelligence may not be entirely separable from its values or goals. As I reflect on the potential for AI to revolutionize our world, I can’t shake off the notion that we must carefully navigate its purpose. After all, the implications of directing vast intellects towards ends that lack depth and relevance to the broader tapestry of life are concerning.\nI’m committed to understanding and advocating for AI that is not just smart, but wise—where the measure of its intelligence is not just in its computational speed or data processing, but in the richness and value of the objectives it’s geared towards. A world where AI works in harmony with the complex and nuanced tapestry of human values is one I strive to influence. The future of AI should not be tethered to the mundane but unleashed to address the grand challenges that can truly benefit humanity.\n\nRead more at: URLShtetl-Optimized\nYou may also be interested in: What AI says about my thinking"},"Notes/Quick-dopamine-and-its-effects-on-health":{"title":"Quick dopamine and its effects on health","links":[],"tags":["-dopamine-on/addiction-on/healthy-mindsets-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nOn Being with Krista Tippett\nKimberley Wilson — Whole Body Mental Health\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/629acd08e6f4a6f5a9723ef7\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nQuick dopamine actually has deep effects on our ability to sit and pay attention\nIt affects our ability to work\nSee also §"},"Notes/Quiet-eye-training":{"title":"Quiet eye training","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Quiet eye training §\nThis is keeping your eye on the ball.\nHaving a steady gaze right before you take action\nhitting a golf ball\nfiring a shot"},"Notes/Quora-Answers-of-Venkatesh-Rao":{"title":"Quora Answers of Venkatesh Rao","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.quora.com/profile/Venkatesh-Rao\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Quote-We-perform-the-operation-without-any-painkillers":{"title":"Quote We perform the operation without any painkillers","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/pain","tags/on/spirituality","tags/recovery","tags/on/addiction"],"tags":["idea-note","pain","on/spirituality","recovery","on/addiction"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#pain#on/spirituality#recovery#on/addiction\nurl:\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThis is a quote from SA that I like\nKey Idea §\nWe perform the operation without any painkillers\nbecause there’s no other way to do it\nAnd it also has to be self operation\nBecause no one can do it except for you\nSee also §"},"Notes/Quote-by-Saint-Francis-of-Assisi":{"title":"Quote by Saint Francis of Assisi","links":["Francis-of-Assisi"],"tags":[],"content":"Quote by Saint Francis of Assisi §\n“Our hands imbibe like roots. so I place them on what is beautiful in this world” §\nSource: §\n\nFrancis of Assisi\n"},"Notes/Quote-by-Søren-Kierkegaard":{"title":"Quote by Søren Kierkegaard","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Søren Kierkegaard\nAbove all, do not lose your desire to walk: Every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it."},"Notes/Quote-on-Play":{"title":"Quote on Play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Quote on Play §\nTrue mastery over a lifetime comes from one’s internal play compass.\nFrom play by\nM.D. Stuart Brown"},"Notes/Quote-on-motivation.-Shipbuilding-and-the-Sea":{"title":"Quote on motivation.

In the optometry office, they call this device a Phoropter. For the purposes of thinking, we’ll call this technique spending time in “Refraction-based thinking”.\n“Refraction” has a different goal than “action”. Refraction is for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Action is about getting things done. Both are essential. Too much refraction and you fall into Hamlet’s trap, who even though he knew his uncle murdered his father, procrastinated from decisive action because of “paralysis by analysis”.\nApplying “refraction” to our thinking is similar to applying a “mental model”, but they tend to stand apart because of the purpose. While Refraction is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding, the use of “Mental Models” is primarily for pattern recognition for efficient, optimal action. The answer here is quite simply to find a balance. (See: Yin and Yang)\nWhen spending time in Refraction Mode, each lens you hold up offers a different view; some more valuable than others, all part of the process.\nWhat is Refraction? Refraction is the turning or bending of any wave, such as a light or sound wave, when it passes from one medium into another of different optical density.\nSome Lenses for Refraction §\n\nThe 7 Dimensions of Wellness\nThe 4 Stoic Virtues\nThe 8-Fold Path\nMy Virtues\n"},"Notes/Reframing-the-Lessons-of-Experience":{"title":"Reframing the Lessons of Experience","links":["Notes/A-Talent-Stack-is-your-experience"],"tags":["learning","critical-thinking","experience"],"content":"Experience is often hailed as the ultimate educator—a belief I’ve held close in my journey. But the wisdom of Soyer and Hogarth in “The Myth of Experience” challenges this notion. It’s an eye-opener: not all lessons from experience are beneficial. The rarity of certain events, like earthquakes, means our exposure is limited, and our lessons, potentially flawed.\nThis brings me to a realization: experience can be a deceptive guide. I’ve seen it firsthand. We encounter a situation, draw conclusions, and then something unprecedented happens. It’s a reminder that what I learn from each experience is filtered through the lens of what I’ve previously encountered, which might not always be the right angle.\nIt’s crucial to dissect experiences critically, asking myself, “Is this a genuine pattern or a one-off event?” This introspection is vital. It keeps my conclusions in check, preventing the misinterpretation of anomalies as norms.\nFor me, it’s become about seeking the delicate balance—valuing experience while being vigilant of its potential to mislead. I have to be as much a critic as a student of my own experiences, ensuring that the right lessons stick.\n\nRead more at: How to Get Better At Learning From Experience\nYou may also be interested in: A Talent Stack is your experience"},"Notes/Regression-to-the-mean-(concept)":{"title":"Regression to the mean (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Regression to the mean in fitness §\nThings will always try to go back to the midpoint.\nSo any kind of progression journey\nWill be more of spike then taper\nor even regress a little"},"Notes/Reid-Hamilton-Fitness":{"title":"Reid Hamilton Fitness","links":["2022-06-16"],"tags":[],"content":"highlights §\n2022-06-16 §\nFollow him on Twitter\nand grabbed these links from his ecosystem\nhttps://mailchi.mp/a173090390ac/ooi8wqz819\nhttps://mailchi.mp/15b9a6cf835b/q5dnfldml3\nStudy and see how he does it"},"Notes/Reimagining-the-Fridge--A-Small-Scale-Approach-to-Waste-Management":{"title":"Reimagining the Fridge: A Small Scale Approach to Waste Management","links":["Food-MOC","Notes/Consumers-Want-Healthier-Food,-Even-if-it-Costs-More"],"tags":["sustainability","efficiency","waste-management","home-management","homesteading"],"content":"Often, when we think of reducing waste and increasing efficiency, we default to big, flashy innovations or lifestyle changes. However, the little highlight from “How to Organize Your Fridge So Food Keeps Longer — and Your Energy Bill Works Harder” serves as a reminder that sometimes, profound impacts start in the nooks and crannies of everyday life—like the shelves of your fridge.\nThe fridge is often underestimated as a potential wasteland. We shove things in, forget about them, and voila! One moldy cucumber later, we’re throwing stuff out. But what if we looked at the fridge not just as a cooling unit but as a control center for waste management? Here’s the game plan: Organize that “bad boy” in sections. Use your fridge doors for foods that can take the temperature fluctuations like a champ—your condiments, juices, etc. Contrary to popular habit, eggs and dairy shouldn’t sit there; they need a cooler sanctuary.\nRemember the phrase, “Ketchup isn’t eternal”? I love it; it adds a sprinkle of humor but also a serious undertone. Even items we think of as almost non-perishable have a shelf life. By giving every food item its designated, climate-controlled space, we’re actually prolonging their life. But this is not just about avoiding waste; it’s also about energy efficiency. A well-organized fridge cools more efficiently, which can translate into energy savings over time.\nThere’s a symmetry here that reminds me of hormesis in training. It’s about balance—stress the food items too much, and they spoil; provide the right environment, and they last longer, saving you both waste and money. The fridge becomes a microcosm of broader principles of sustainability and waste management. It’s a confined space where you can actually see the consequences of your choices, like a petri dish for your eco-friendly ambitions.\nIn this context, I see the fridge as a small yet potent platform to exercise responsible consumption. It’s more than a kitchen appliance; it’s a miniature ecosystem where your decisions can help—or hurt—the larger world around you.\n\nRead more at: How to Organize Your Fridge: Keeping Your Food Fresher for Longer\nGo one level up : Food MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Consumers Want Healthier Food, Even if it Costs More"},"Notes/Reinforcement-management-in-the-Transtheoretical-model":{"title":"Reinforcement management in the Transtheoretical model","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Reinforcement management §\nContext §\nWhat is it §\nRewarding oneself when you do good behaviors\nLike a dog almost"},"Notes/Relax-and-Win-WW2-Boxers":{"title":"Relax and Win WW2 Boxers","links":["Notes/The-Relaxation-Mode"],"tags":["-on/relax-history-ww2-on/performance--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nLegacy of Speed\nRelax and Win From Legacy of Speed\nMalcom Gladwell\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62ac472f62ce94f7a90f523e\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nWW2 pilots under a lot of stress\nMaking mistakes\nTeaching people how to relax\nApplied to boxers\nRelax and Win\n\nBud’s book from ?\nWorks with boxers and fighter pilots\n\nSee also §\nThe Relaxation Mode"},"Notes/Relaxation-and-Performance":{"title":"Relaxation and Performance","links":[],"tags":["-relaxation-on/performance-mindset--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nLegacy of Speed\nRelax and Win From Legacy of Speed\nMalcom Gladwell\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nRelaxation is so important to performance\nInstead of no pain no gain\nRelax to perform better\nis crazy because it’s completely different\nHe has key phrases\nloose hands loose jaw\nSee also §"},"Notes/Rely-on-Invisible-workouts":{"title":"Rely on Invisible Workouts","links":["Exercises-MOC","Notes/Find-your-reps"],"tags":["-pareto-","-invisible-","-unseen-","-unsexy-"],"content":"There’s the stand up video rant by Red Ollero on how many calories you burn on a treadmill- find the link.\nAnd if you’re trying to do through it through food you’re in trouble.

That’s when Ahmed turned his eyes toward what others were doing—in this case, Peloton’s subscription-based model.\nNow, why does this resonate with me?

Traditional tactics like surveys or quick-fix lead magnets miss the soul of this journey. Here’s how to rethink the game:\n\n\nCommunity Over Surveys: The experience of transformation is often collective. Create a hive, not a questionnaire. For instance, think “90-Day Fitness Journey Community,” not “30-question intake survey.”\n\n\nShowcasing Progress: Nothing motivates like evidence. Facilitate a space where members can share milestones and setbacks alike, creating a narrative of authentic transformation.\n\n\nThe Alchemy of Interaction: Want to expedite someone’s transformation? Don’t just dump information; create a vortex of interaction. Ponder on this: How can the community be a catalyst for faster, deeper change?\n\n\nThe Middle Is Where Magic Happens: The middle of the funnel is often seen as a mere transit zone. But this is where the alchemy occurs—through nurturing. The currency isn’t just freebies; it’s the continuous infusion of opportunities to grow, ideally through community interactions and helpful resources.\n\n\nThe missing ingredient in many sales funnels is the sense of caring that turns transactions into transformations.

An extended hiatus, rather than recharging my batteries, can twist time into an unstructured void, where midday naps replace meaningful activity, and the once calming practice of self-reflection spirals into existential dread.\nThe Laboratory of Life: Embracing Experimentation\nIn my journey, I’ve discovered that the antidote to this paralysis isn’t more rest, but a deliberate action. It’s about transforming the self-care space into a laboratory for experimentation — where trying activities outside my comfort zone becomes the new routine. This is where I’ve learned to flirt with work that I previously dismissed, finding passion in unexpected corners.\nBalancing Ambitions: The Overachiever’s Dilemma\nFor a natural overachiever, engagement often requires a duality of intention: the ability to oscillate between the Zen-like detachment of “outcome independence” and the fiery drive of ambitious goals. In my own experience, composing music embodies this duality. I am at peace with the joy of creation, yet part of me dreams of grand stages and international acclaim. Accepting this dichotomy as natural has been liberating.\n\nRead more at: Site Unreachable\nYou may also be interested in: CROSS"},"Notes/Rethinking-conventional-fitness-wisdom":{"title":"Rethinking conventional fitness wisdom","links":["Notes/Hysteresis-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"Rethinking conventional fitness wisdom §\nConvential wisdom that isn’t true.\nYou have to train hard every day\nYeah if you want to run a marathon.\nBut if you want to\nnot get heart disease\nbe happy\nThe minimum is so low\nHysteresis (concept)"},"Notes/Reversible-decisions-and-irreversible-decisions":{"title":"Reversible decisions and irreversible decisions","links":["Notes/Fear-mongering--Alcohol-kills-brain-cells,-and-the-don't-come-back!","Notes/The-Best-time-to-plant-a-tree-(quote)"],"tags":[],"content":"Reversible decisions and irreversible decisions §\nMost in fitness are reversible\nFear mongering  Alcohol kills brain cells, and the don’t come back!\nThat’s not true.\nIt’s never too late\nStart now\nThe Best time to plant a tree (quote)\nThings are more reversible than you think\nVery few decision in life are actually completely irreversible"},"Notes/Revisiting-your-workouts":{"title":"Revisiting your workouts","links":["Notes/My-Canon-of-Books","Notes/Beginner's-Mind","Notes/The-key-kasi-is-reflection"],"tags":[],"content":"Revisiting your workouts §\nAnalogy §\n\n\nI reread LOTR\n\n\nI reread Dante\n\n\nI rewatch LOTR\n\n\nIt’s a different experience each time\n\n\nThese are things where I like the journey not the destination\n\n\nFor example, I would walk the camino again.\n\n\nBecause it’s not an experience to consume, but one to journey through\n\n\nKey Idea §\n\nAre there workouts or programs where you enjoy the journey?\nDon’t think of workouts as one and dones\nCan you revisit it in a fun way?\n\nSee also §\n\nMy Canon of Books\nBeginner’s Mind\nThe key kasi is reflection\n"},"Notes/Reviving-the-Essence-of-Play-for-All-Ages":{"title":"Reviving the Essence of Play for All Ages","links":["Maps/Movement-MOC","Notes/Free-play-and-structured-play-in-children"],"tags":["play","mental-health","society","wellbeing","aging"],"content":"In the modern world, the concept of play has been restricted to children, often framed as a phase of life that ends once adult responsibilities kick in. This truncated perspective overlooks the profound psychological and physiological benefits of play that extend throughout one’s lifetime.\nPlay is not a childish endeavor but an essential facet of human nature that nurtures creativity, problem-solving abilities, and emotional resilience.\nThe societal drift towards productivity and “useful” activities has not only stripped children of unstructured playtime but also deprived adults of the joy and stress-relief that come from playful activities. This can contribute to rising rates of mental health issues across all age groups.\nWe should be asking ourselves why we took play away from children and made it about productivity, rather than extending the liberty to play to all age groups. It’s time to redefine play as a lifelong necessity, not just a childhood luxury.\nInstead of seeing play as something we grow out of, let’s consider it something we grow into—continuously, at every stage of our lives.\n\nRead more at: Issue No. 245: Prescribing Play | Fitt Insider\nGo one level up : Movement MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Free play and structured play in children"},"Notes/Richard-Schmidt":{"title":"Richard Schmidt","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Richard Schmidt §\nMotor learning"},"Notes/Ridgeview-Floor-Area":{"title":"Ridgeview Floor Area","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is the info I give when the cleaners ask\n\nAbout 180sqm inside\nAbout 270sqm altogether with garden and back area\n"},"Notes/Ridgeview-Utility-Numbers":{"title":"Ridgeview Utility Numbers","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nFor searching purposes\nElectrician\n\nBeng Pablo (+639178479772)\n\nContacted him before, really good and responsive\n\n\n\nPlumber\nCleaner\n\nWe tend to use Linis Bilis\nThey are very good\n\nAKKG is the aircon and they do well too\n\n+63977 740 1455\n"},"Notes/Rigenera-for-savenous-wind-turbines":{"title":"Rigenera for savenous wind turbines","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Rigenera for savenous wind turbines"},"Notes/Robin-Hood":{"title":"Robin Hood","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"robin hood rhcrco@gmail.com 360-688-3922"},"Notes/Robin-Jackim":{"title":"Robin Jackim","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"baysidecoachrobin@gmail.com"},"Notes/Robots-winking-communicating-meaning-and-intentionality":{"title":"Robots winking communicating meaning and intentionality","links":[],"tags":["-on/spirituality-mutuality-imperfection-on/community-communication-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nA Psalm for the Wild Built\nby Becky Chambers\nMonk and the Robot\nurl:  (Location 1015)\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nOne of Mosscap’s eyes quickly switched off, then on again.

George Santayana’s sage warning that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” seems to manifest in these ever-recurring discussions.\nIn my experience, academia offers us a lens to study the subtle nuances and shifts in these debates over time. It’s not that the arguments themselves are new, but the context around them—technological, social, or otherwise—may introduce additional layers or subtleties. This is the brilliance of academia; it allows us to remember and hopefully break free from these cycles.\nIt leads me to ponder: how do we ensure that these studies and discussions move us forward, rather than having us spin in circles? After all, if the purpose of studying history is to avoid past mistakes, are we failing if the same arguments resurface?\nBy bringing a historical perspective into current debates, we do more than just contextualize; we offer a roadmap for how to avoid retreading the same ground. It’s not about stifling conversation but enhancing it by adding a layer of awareness that only comes from understanding our past.\nIt’s essential to involve multiple perspectives in these discussions, both from academia and everyday experience. By combining these, we might escape the trap of cyclical debates and enact meaningful change.\nIt’s worth noting that while the core of these debates may remain unchanged, the mechanisms through which they are discussed have evolved, mostly thanks to technology.

The preservation and subsequent unveiling of documents from that era did more than bring hidden truths to light; they provided validation to the persistent and multi-generational struggle for freedom in the Philippines, connecting the resistance against Marcos to a broader historical continuum.\nContemporary contentions are not waged solely on tangible battlefields but within the vast, nebulous realms of social media. Here, the fight is subtle, a war of attrition against the truth. Heroes of expression like Maria Ressa face new breeds of adversaries: not visible armies, but faceless trolls and the specter of legal battles, exemplifying how the narrative is as much a weapon as it was in the days of overt censorship.\nAs I reflect on this, I am reminded of the importance of vigilance in the face of these less overt but equally potent threats to freedom. The mechanisms of control have evolved, employing a guise of decentralization. Yet, the essence remains—a struggle against the imposition of a single narrative.\nWe must recognize that while the tools have changed, the essence of control remains the same, only repackaged in the form of social media influence and astroturfing. In my work, I underscore the value of scrutinizing the source and intent behind information, advocating for a well-informed community that can discern the grassroots from the astroturf.\nThis account of the Marcos years, then, serves not merely as a historical recount but as a cautionary tale and a clarion call to remain steadfast in our pursuit of truth, understanding that the shape of resistance must evolve in tandem with the methods of oppression.\n\nRead more at: Sheila S.

It suggests two main pathways: either intensify the pain associated with not taking action or heighten the pleasure derived from acting.\nThis concept aligns closely with James Clear’s philosophy in “Atomic Habits.” Both focus on leveraging the pain-pleasure principle to drive behavioral change. Clear goes a step further by dissecting the habit loop and offering practical techniques to make good habits more rewarding and bad habits more unsatisfying.\nIn my own experience, playing with these levers of pain and pleasure can be incredibly effective. For instance, creating a sense of urgency or fear about the consequences of inaction makes me more inclined to move. On the flip side, finding joy in the process of action—as opposed to just the outcome—can turn an otherwise tedious task into a satisfying endeavor.\nHowever, it’s not just about individual actions; it’s about cultivating a lifestyle that supports your goals. So, the question becomes: How can we implement Skinner’s Law into a broader habit formation strategy? It’s crucial to understand the deeper psychological currents that underpin our behavior if we’re to manipulate them effectively.\nBy extending the principles of Skinner’s Law across different facets of our life, we can develop a more holistic understanding of what drives us to act or remain stagnant.

Usually say what you want as a fan of capitalism about the efficiency of these modern conditions of production. That’s undeniable. But there was always a trade off and one of the trade offs here from Marks and de boer is going to be that the consumer is fundamentally alienated from the creative process of everything that they buy that performs an important function in their\nlife, because we no longer have to actually make the stuff that we use every day. We don’t ever have to consider all the other people.\nYou can’t just choose to abstain from the economic system. Like someone can just walk out of a catholic mass. If they think it’s all nonsense, you have to be a part of it in some way. And as you do that, there are literally teams of people out there working in close correlation with algorithms. Super smart people where their entire job is to look at your tendencies on these screens and find any way they can to get you to spend more time contemplating the spectacle instead of living, there is so much more to talk about here\nYou see the same thing emerged at the heads of companies in the private sector, you have these enormously powerful people that are the faces of giant businesses and you’re sold. What feels like a marketing campaign about how brilliant these people are. Like they’re playing 4D chess at a level no one can fully understand because they’re just not as smart as them. But then you do some digging into the other side of the story and it’s like, are these people really unparalleled intellects of our time that are gonna save the world or is this a marketing campaign? I’m being sold to instill confidence in shareholders because the markets based on mass psychology. Again, the funny thing to Tabor is that even if it is just a marketing campaign for a lot of people out there. It doesn’t even really bother them that much.\nThat’s interesting because the goal of society is to separate you from the means of everything. I was really struck by phrase and idea of being separated to the means of consumption. Like the goal of capitalism is not separate you from what you make but also from what you consume.\nYou have no idea where anything comes from. And you are worse of (or better depending on your perspective) either way, your stuff just works like a magical object.\nThat reminds me The fragility of food systems and The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\nIt’s similar because food systems are the same. No one knows where food comes from. It’s just like magic. When you start to think about where your food actually comes from you have no idea. And I like to know. Because I want to be responsible. I want to take responsibilty for what I eat, earn and do.\nIt’s different because For some people this is a good thing. Being able to not think about where you are getting things from.\nIt’s important because it’s important to know. If you want to be a responsible person, you should do this.\n\nRead more at: Episode | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nSnippets:\nAirrQuote | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nAirrQuote | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nAirrQuote | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nGo one level up : Philosophy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Capitalism and it destroys the health of workers"},"Notes/SolarPunk":{"title":"SolarPunk","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Our Changing Climate video on Nebula"},"Notes/Solutions-to-Flow-Stoppers":{"title":"Solutions to Flow Stoppers","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/flow","Notes/Enthusiasm-(re-Flow)","Notes/Attention-(re-Flow)","Notes/Direction-(re-Flow)","Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)"],"tags":["flow"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#flow\nSolutions to Flow Stoppers §\n\n Organize these using the four factors\n\n\nReduce Distractions — This is the number one killer of flow. (Main Element: Attention)\nDo activities you naturally want to do — Obviously this can get you in trouble if these activities take you away from your responsibilities to your family, finances, friends, and to society as a whole. So with that disclaimer out of the way, if you do the things that easily get you into flow—and ideally create some sort of additional value (extra money, quality time with others)—then it’s likely not a destructive type of flow (like playing online games too much). (Main Element: Enthusiasm (re Flow))\nReduce the amount of competing things you want to do — Too many projects, desires, and wants can make them all slip through your fingers, or as said in the Count of Monte Cristo, “evaporate into a thousand follies.” (Main Elements: Attention (re Flow), Direction (re Flow))\n\nNarrow your attention — In the moment, take a mental step back and try to narrow your attention on the task at hand. If you’re at a computer screen, this means closing tabs and applications and eliminating things that are robbing your attention.\n\n\nTake a deep breath, take a walk, change your environment — Whether it’s burnout, lowered energy from sitting too much, or just feeling overwhelm; knowing when (and how) to change things up is a crucial skill for many things—including for recentering so you can once again find flow. (Main Element: Energy (re Flow), Attention (re Flow))\nTie your present activity to your goals in some way — More often than not, we find ourselves doing something we wish we weren’t doing. Try to find a way to relate the activity to your goals in some way. (Main Elements: Direction (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow))\n\nMake a game out of it — So you really don’t see any strong connection between your activity and your goals, so you just can’t seem to summon the enthusiasm for it. So try making a game out of it. How fast can you get the task done with complete focus and zero distractions? If it’s an event with people, maybe try to get into a few higher, quality, deeper conversations; or maybe just make a game out of asking really good questions. (Main Elements: Direction (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow))\n\n\nSleep well. Eat Well. Hydrate well — If your energy is low because you’ve somehow neglected taking care of yourself, then it will be much harder to induce flow because low energy means decreased mood and increased distractibility.

In copywriting terms, it is the FEATURES.\nYour target audience, your customer, is likely not the educated fitness consumer, or a fit pro.\nAnd you know from copywriting that we don’t emphasise FEATURES in the copy. We emphasise BENEFITS. Talking about the HOW isn’t so important for your target audience.\nYour target audience has a PROBLEM. In your messaging, you need to demonstrate that you understand their problem (EMPATHY) and that you know how to solve it (AUTHORITY)\nWhen you describe the type of person you work with, and the problems they solve in detail (AGITATE), people will read it and think “Hey, it’s as if he’s speaking to me!”\nPROBLEM AGITATE SOLUTION A common copywriting framework\nSo just based off what you’ve told me\n\nslow and steady &gt; helping you adopt the right mindset &gt; not guilting you into health\n\nWhat kind of person would that appeal to? Someone who is overwhelmed, feels guilty that they’ve not been exercising or eating in a way that supports them, maybe has a poor relationship with exercise, and maybe doesn’t have a lot of free time.\nSo you can start to create small pieces of copy around the microproblems they face in everyday life\nThe more specific the better.\nFor example, instead of saying “Are you fat? Join my fitness program!”\nYou might say “Do you hate going shopping for jeans, because nothing seems to fit right? The lighting in the changing room makes you look bloated. You leave feeling fat, self-conscious and without making a purchase.” roll into CTA\nOr you can create story around that that same concept, maybe with a current client.\n“Janine used to hate going shopping for jeans, because nothing seems to fit right. The lighting in the changing room made her feel fat and bloated. She would leave the store feeling sad, self-conscious, and without making a purchase. Since Janine started with Javier’s Go Slow fitness community, she reduced her waistline by 10cm. Now clothes fit her better, and she loves shopping again because she has plenty of options! If you’ve been having a miserable time when out shopping, click this link and book a 20 min introductory call with Javier today. [link]” Add an image of Janine smiling and happy to extend the story to the visual piece for additional effectiveness, and you’ve got a content piece that will resonate with your target audience.\nThe above example is for a fat loss audience. It targets an exterior motivation (appearance) but goes deeper into the way it makes them feel (interior).\nYou could take it down another level (philosophical) by using galvanising phrases like “No one should have to feel…” but for the most part addressing interior and exterior is plenty to get started with.\nOkay, that was a lot.

It’s an extremely strong form of memory. A term for using a spatial context for memory is called the Method of Loci.\nSee the main maps I included in the Home note?

While this might sound painfully obvious, the devil is truly in the details. The article “You 2.0” urges us to be specific in our aspirations. But why does specificity matter so much? Here’s the deal: vague goals are the dream-killers. They’re the desert mirages that keep you chasing an illusion.\nJust saying “I want to be successful” or “I want to grow my coaching business” lacks the precision necessary for actionable steps. It’s like telling your GPS, “Take me somewhere fun!” Sure, you might end up somewhere interesting, but is it the destination you truly desired? Highly unlikely.\nIn my experience, clarity acts like a compass. When I pin down specifics—such as “I aim to add $70K to my freelance revenue” or “I’m shooting for 10K subscribers for my newsletter”—the fog lifts. The nebulous transforms into the tangible. My brain then flips into problem-solving mode, finding avenues I hadn’t even considered before. This is because specificity acts as a sort of language that your brain understands—much like how it efficiently uses shortcuts to resist change.\nConversely, ever wondered why your body and mind resist vague changes? It’s the same reason; the lack of clarity creates a maze without an exit. Your brain doesn’t know which “shortcut” to take. In entrepreneurial terms, think of specificity as your business plan. Without it, you’re sailing without a map, susceptible to the storms of doubt and the whirlpools of indecision.\nSo, if you want to venture beyond the land of wishful thinking into the realm of tangible accomplishments, get specific. And not just “newsletter-launching” specific, but “first-10K-subscribers” specific. It’s that granular detail that turns what could be just another introspective thought into an actionable strategy.\n\nRead more at: What do you want to accomplish in your life? 7 sample answers\nGo one level up : Entrepreneurship MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Kye He The Case Against Goals"},"Notes/Speed,-Explosiveness-is-very-High-level-movement":{"title":"Speed, Explosiveness is very High level movement","links":["Notes/Dan-John's-Intervention","Dan-John","Notes/Assume-You're-below-average"],"tags":[],"content":"The final progression is speed (very few people need to be here) §\nSource: §\n\nDan John’s Intervention\nby Dan John\n\nHighlights (Key Ideas) §\n\nDan John has this quote: “Don’t add speed on top of dysfunction”\n\nIt’s a recipe for pain and injury\n\n\nAnother way of looking at this, is that everyone wants to do the speed progression\n\nThat’s the fun part that looks cool\nBut very few of us will actually perform here.\nThis is world class level\n\n\n\nSee also §\n\nAssume You’re below average\n"},"Notes/Spending-for-Health-Trap":{"title":"Spending for Health Trap","links":["TMBA598-Winning-With-Twitter-and-Writing-for-the-Web-With-David-Perell","Notes/Powerful-Idea-of-Spending-your-health"],"tags":["money","health","healthy-mindsets"],"content":"I end up feeling like some gadget will improve my health\nBut that’s a trap.

For example, someone may not be interested in developing a habit of regular exercise, but they may be motivated by the desire to fit back into a specific dress that they haven’t been able to wear in a while.\nThis concept also suggests that coaches should avoid identifying themselves as “habits coaches” or other specific labels, as people are not typically searching for a coach in that specific area. Instead, coaches should focus on meeting clients where they are currently at and understanding their specific goals and motivations. This will allow the coach to better tailor their approach and connect with the client on a deeper level.\nAdditionally, the idea is also pointing out that coaches often make the mistake of diving too deep into the coaching process too soon before earning the right to do so. It’s important for coaches to understand that building trust and rapport with the clients is essential to be able to take them where they want to go, and the process of earning trust takes time.\nIn summary, the idea is that people are motivated by the results of good habits, not the habits themselves. Coaches should focus on understanding the clients’ goals and meeting them where they are currently at, rather than identifying themselves as a specific type of coach. Building trust and rapport is essential to be able to take the clients where they want to go.\nThat’s interesting because\nThat reminds me\nIt’s similar because\nIt’s different because\nIt’s important because"},"Notes/Stop-bracing-and-move-subconsciously":{"title":"Stop bracing and move subconsciously","links":["Notes/Train-for-things-to-be-pretty","Notes/Good-movement-usually-looks-pretty-(concept)"],"tags":["-movement-subconscious-trust-on/body-awareness--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThe Peter Attia Drive\nThe Art of Stability | Beth Lewis\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62de49ce9280c589ea29e098\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nSo how do you learn to not brace all the time?

It’s not just about sporadic postings but about strategic presence. A home base isn’t just a platform; it’s a strategic focal point, a place where you invest your energy to connect with your community.\nSo, what’s the ideal platform? Where you feel most “yourself,” where your community thrives, and where your content has the best chance to go viral. It’s about striking a balance between authenticity, opportunity, and community presence.\nAnd about that elusive audience? It’s an ongoing process for me as well. Finding the sweet spot requires persistent fine-tuning. The right questions guide the strategy. Do I feel real and true on this platform? Where are my people hanging out online? Is this platform conducive to the viral aspects of my work?\nFor maintaining consistency, it’s less about scheduling each post and more about preparing a reservoir of ideas. As someone who’s been seeking to connect more authentically with an audience, I find the idea of a “content ammo” quite liberating. It gives me the freedom to post when I “feel it,” yet ensures I have a steady stream of quality content to share.\nThe idea isn’t just to ‘be’ online but to be there strategically, aligning platform choice and content scheduling with one’s unique goals and audience. Planning is good, but don’t let rigidity stifle spontaneity.

Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then –and this is the “weakly held” part– prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result. - Paul Saffo, circa 2008\n\nWeak opinions are problematic because people aren’t inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the energy required to test them.\nEqually, don’t be too attached to what you believe, otherwise, it undermines your ability to “see” and “hear” evidence that clashes with your opinions.

However, the evolution of these subcultures often attracts a spectrum of participants, each playing a critical role in its lifecycle.\nIntrigued by Venkatesh Rao’s Gervais Principle, which dissects corporate ecosystems with a lens of cynical clarity, we find parallels in subcultural spaces. Two archetypes stand out: mops, the casual enthusiasts, and sociopaths, the opportunists. Mops are the audience that brings vitality but not depth, engaging with the surface joy of the New Thing without immersing in its intricacies. Sociopaths, on the other hand, are the charismatic extractors of value, often fooling mops with the illusion of creation while siphoning the subculture’s cultural capital for personal gain.\nThis dance of deception is all too familiar in the fitness industry, where grifters masquerade as innovators, drawing in mops with the allure of quick fixes and effortless results. They dilute the essence of the community, overshadowing the true creators—the fanatics whose passion is the lifeblood of the culture.\nFor a health coach and entrepreneur, the focus must remain on these fanatics. They are the cornerstone of a genuine community, the ones who will not only invest in the vision but also contribute to its growth and sustainability. The challenge lies in nurturing this core while safeguarding the subculture from the diluting forces of mops and the predatory tactics of sociopaths.\n\nRead more at: Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution | Meaningness\nYou may also be interested in: Building a community is a key thing but is so hard"},"Notes/Summer-Dormancy":{"title":"Summer Dormancy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"You actually shouldn’t water §\nDuring Summer dormancy\nLet plants rest\nNothing grows all the time\nThere are cycles"},"Notes/Sun-Shades-Portable":{"title":"Sun Shades Portable","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Portable Sun Shade §\nhttps://moonfab.com"},"Notes/Super-Thinking-(book-outline)":{"title":"Super Thinking (book outline)","links":["Notes/Gabriel-Weinberg","Lauren-McCann","tags/on/books"],"tags":["on/books"],"content":"Super Thinking §\n\nMetadata §\n\nAuthor: Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann\nFull Title: Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models\nCategory:#on/books\n"},"Notes/Support-is-greater-than-advice":{"title":"Support is greater than advice","links":[],"tags":["-coaching-habits-support-on/accountability-"],"content":"My writing (250-300 words) §\nTurns out support is better than advice\nNo cross talk thing\nYou’re not trying to solve other people’s problems\nThat’s not your job\nYou’re helping people in their journey of learning to help themselves\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §\nurl:"},"Notes/Surveying":{"title":"Surveying","links":[],"tags":["-surveying-land-"],"content":"Sight level\nSurveying equipment\nLevelling Staff"},"Notes/Survival-of-the-Fittest":{"title":"Survival of the Fittest","links":["tags/note/boat"],"tags":["note/boat"],"content":"up::\ntags::#note/boat🚤\nSurvival of the Fittest §\nWiki §\n\n”Survival of the Fittest” is a phrase that originated from Darwinian evolutionary theory as a way of describing the mechanism of natural selection. The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms, the phrase is best understood as “Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.”\nHerbert Spencer first used the phrase, after reading Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, in his Principles of Biology (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin’s biological ones: “This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called ‘natural selection’, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.”Darwin responded positively to Alfred Russel Wallace’s suggestion of using Spencer’s new phrase “survival of the fittest” as an alternative to “natural selection”, and adopted the phrase in The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication published in 1868. In On the Origin of Species, he introduced the phrase in the fifth edition published in 1869, intending it to mean “better designed for an immediate, local environment”.\nWikipedia\n\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2017\ncreated:: 2017\ncoined:: 1864\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Sustainable-Weight-Loss--A-Journey,-Not-a-Sprint":{"title":"Sustainable Weight Loss: A Journey, Not a Sprint","links":["Notes/How-Mindset-affects-Weight-Loss"],"tags":["sustainable-weight-loss","weight-loss","behavioral-psychology","goal-setting","nutrition","flexibility"],"content":"Embarking on a weight loss journey often feels like standing at the base of a mountain. The initial phase is challenging, fraught with self-doubt and setbacks. However, the highlighted experience underscores the value of approaching weight loss as a long-term lifestyle change rather than a quick fix. I’ve always believed that flexibility in diet, instead of strict adherence to fads, allows for sustainable change.\nThe use of the Noom application is noteworthy. It didn’t present revolutionary dietary advice but shifted the focus towards the psychology of eating. Sometimes we need to be reminded of what we already know, bringing subconscious habits to the surface. That’s particularly crucial in the early stages of any weight loss journey, where every decision feels magnified. It’s not unlike my early days in entrepreneurship; the initial hurdles felt insurmountable, but with time and evolving strategies, the path became clearer.\nThe transition from a ‘first push’ to a sustainable lifestyle change is crucial. Just like in business, as you reach different stages, the strategies that got you there may not be the ones to sustain you. The key takeaway here is that weight loss, like any other significant life change, requires an evolving approach based on self-awareness and a long-term vision.\nThe merit of this approach is that it doesn’t cage you into a rigid regime but rather encourages moderation. You’re not abstaining but choosing, not restricting but moderating—thus avoiding the dreaded “yo-yo” effect that many face in their weight loss journeys.\n\nRead more at: How I Lost 65 Pounds In 18 Months Without Any Fad Diets or Gimmicks | by Mark Suster | Both Sides of the Table\nYou may also be interested in: How Mindset affects Weight Loss"},"Notes/Swamp-Cooler":{"title":"Swamp Cooler","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"What is a Swamp Cooler §\nIt seems like a way to cool things"},"Notes/Synthesis":{"title":"Synthesis","links":["Maps/Concepts-MOC","tags/concept","Convergence","201408190641","Notes/MOCs-are-Dialectics"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"up:: Concepts MOC\ntags::#concept\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nSome content and links have been removed.\n\n\nSynthesis §\nThe combining of separate elements or substances to form a coherent whole.\nRelated: Convergence\nExample Usage, Keywords, Concepts, and Metaphors §\n\nThesis.

But the opposite is true. Our brain loves feeling like it’s winning. And by giving it small wins, it’s willing to do more of that.

It’s like a shadow that follows us into adulthood, affecting our decisions, actions, and even our self-worth. Research shows a direct correlation between parental expectations and a child’s fear of failure. The more parents react negatively to perceived failures, the more the child internalizes this fear, sometimes to the point of developing atychiphobia—an irrational and paralyzing fear of failure.\nSpeaking from personal experience, I can attest to the weight of this fear. As someone who has always strived to excel in athletics, the fear of not meeting my own high standards has become a constant companion. It’s like running a race with a backpack full of bricks; it slows you down and exhausts you, but you can’t seem to take it off.\nThis brings to mind the concept of hormesis in exercise and stress management. Just as a certain amount of stress can be beneficial for growth, perhaps what’s needed is a balanced approach to failure. The key is to reframe it not as a dead-end but as a detour on the road to success.\nSo, how do we confront this fear? One actionable experiment could be to deliberately put ourselves in situations where failure is a possibility but the stakes are low. For example, giving a talk at a local meetup, producing a single podcast episode, or writing an article and sharing it with a few friends. The idea is to expose ourselves to the fear in a controlled setting, thereby desensitizing ourselves to it over time.\nIn summary, the fear of failure is not just an individual problem but a systemic one, often rooted in early life experiences and societal expectations. However, by understanding its origins and actively working to confront it, we can turn this fear into a catalyst for personal growth.\n\nRead more at: Fail like a scientist to overcome your fear of failure - Ness Labs\nGo one level up : Psychology MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Power and Fear of Public Commitment in Fitness Goals"},"Notes/The-Archaeology-of-Zelda":{"title":"The Archaeology of Zelda","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Archaeology of Zelda §\nhttps://twitter.com/archaeologygame/status/1434861162999468036?s=21"},"Notes/The-Archer's-Need-to-Win":{"title":"The Archer's Need to Win","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Archer’s Need to Win §\nThis wokrs as a story §\nIt’s kinda on the nose\nhttp://taoessentials.blogspot.com/2012/01/chuang-tzu-archers-need-to-win.html\nFrom\nChuang Tsu\nI read the Merton Translation"},"Notes/The-Art-of-Behavioral-'Copy-Pasting'":{"title":"The Art of Behavioral 'Copy-Pasting'","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","Habit-Stacking-by-James-Clear"],"tags":["behavior-change","behavior","coaching","health-coaching","learning","efficiency"],"content":"Much like a compelling blog template or a code snippet that saves countless hours of work, the concept of “copy and paste” isn’t just relegated to the world of tech. It can be a powerful tool in mastering new skills or lifestyle changes. If it worked for Kassie in adopting a vegetarian lifestyle, who’s to say it can’t be a part of our arsenal in making lasting changes?\nIn the health and fitness coaching landscape where I navigate, the instinct is often to tailor everything to the individual, to make it “unique.” But let’s be honest: reinventing the wheel every time isn’t just tedious—it’s often unnecessary. The balance between customization and efficiency is like that of an athlete knowing when to push and when to rest. The “copy and paste” strategy offers a useful blueprint to springboard off of.\nThis approach fits snugly with the principle of “standing on the shoulders of giants.” Why slog through the swamp of trial and error when there are proven paths you can follow? As in, if a vegetarian lifestyle is achieved successfully with particular meal strategies, one can replicate that method without a second thought.\nI believe that we could weave this strategy into the coaching practice seamlessly. There’s a sort of elegance in finding what works, cloning it, and then tweaking it to fit one’s needs. After all, isn’t that what successful businesses, great athletes, and even ecosystems do? They adapt based on existing successful models. It’s a lesson in humility, acknowledging that others might have cracked a code you’re trying to decipher.\nSo, my respect for the “copy and paste” strategy grows. It’s not about abandoning innovation but recognizing that innovation often comes from iteration, not ideation. Why not give our clients—and ourselves—the best possible starting point?\n\nRead more at: To Kickstart a New Behavior, Copy and Paste - By Katy Milkman - Behavioral Scientist\nGo one level up : Habits MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Habit Stacking by James Clear"},"Notes/The-Art-of-Being--Why-Comparison-is-the-Thief-of-Joy":{"title":"The Art of Being: Why Comparison is the Thief of Joy","links":["Poetry-MOC","Notes/Don't-Let-Imposter-Syndrome-Stop-you"],"tags":["self-compassion","comparison","voice","relative","relationships"],"content":"The Trap of Comparison\nPaudre Gautuma’s words resonate deeply with me. In a world that often feels like a constant competition, it’s easy to fall into the trap of comparison. Whether it’s in the realm of poetry, health coaching, or any other field, comparing oneself to others can be a creativity killer. It’s like a mental treadmill—you’re running but going nowhere.\nThe Value of Learning\nThat’s not to say we should exist in a vacuum. Learning from others is crucial. It’s how we grow and evolve in our respective fields. But there’s a fine line between learning and comparing. The former empowers us; the latter disempowers us. It’s the difference between seeing someone’s work and thinking, “What can I learn from this?” versus “Why can’t I be like this?”\nLate Bloomers and the Illusion of Time\nFeeling like you’ve come late to something shouldn’t diminish your passion or your potential contributions. In fact, sometimes coming in “late” can offer a fresh perspective, unburdened by the jadedness that can come with years in a field. It’s never too late to make a meaningful impact.\nWhy This Matters to Me\nAs someone who’s building a coaching practice and striving to be a thought leader, I find this a timely reminder. Comparison can be a significant roadblock, but it’s one that can be overcome by focusing on my unique voice and contributions. It’s not about being the first or the best; it’s about being authentically me.\n\nRead more at: Vidyan Ravinthiran — Artist | The On Being Project\nGo one level up : Poetry MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Don’t Let Imposter Syndrome Stop you"},"Notes/The-Art-of-Body-Balance-in-a-World-of-Overwhelm":{"title":"The Art of Body Balance in a World of Overwhelm","links":["Maps/Physical-Training-MOC","Notes/Don't-push-yourself,-pull-yourself"],"tags":["body-balance","self-assessment","holistic-health","practical-fitness"],"content":"We often think of balancing our bodies as a Herculean task requiring monumental effort. In the overwhelming maze of health tips, tests, and benchmarks, one can easily lose sight of the forest for the trees. The wisdom from “An Owner’s Manual for Your Body” serves as a refreshing guide to navigate this maze. It drives home the point that balancing your body doesn’t have to be an exhausting struggle. In fact, it can be integrated into the nooks and crannies of our everyday lives.\nFor instance, the book discusses 10 tests and 10 corresponding practices to assess and improve vital signs. The beauty lies in the simplicity and accessibility of these practices. Like little islands of mindfulness, they can be scattered throughout your day. No Herculean efforts, no massive time commitments. Just small changes that cumulatively create a sea change.\nBut here’s where it gets tricky. You might be thinking, “With all these resources, why isn’t everyone a paradigm of health?” Well, the problem is not a lack of information but rather a lack of true knowledge. In a world teeming with fitness “noise,” discerning the melody that harmonizes with your body is the real challenge. Trust me, I get it. When you’re delving deep into health and coaching, you realize that balance isn’t a one-size-fits-all blueprint but a personalized work of art.\nThink of it as cooking a complex dish; you’ve got numerous ingredients, each contributing its own flavor. Too much of one and the dish is ruined, too little of another and it’s bland. The same goes for body balance, which is an amalgamation of nutrition, sleep, exercise, breathing, and even mental well-being. You’re the chef, and you’ve got to find the unique recipe that brings out the best in you.\nBombus, a company mentioned in the article, with its charitable mission tied into everyday products like socks and t-shirts, is a fascinating example of integrating something meaningful into the mundane. Imagine if we did that with our health—sprinkling pockets of meaningful, health-boosting activities throughout our daily routines.\nUnderstanding the “micro” can indeed help us master the “macro.” In a world that seems to constantly demand more from us, perhaps it’s time we demand more from it—in small, sustainable bites. After all, it’s often the subtle strokes that complete the masterpiece.\n\nRead more at: #611.

But what if the story started with the most critical or exciting moment? The principle of “starting your story right before you get eaten by the bear” asserts that people are most engaged when they’re immediately presented with something compelling.\nMaking Storytelling Powerful\nTo make your storytelling more impactful, the idea is to cut the fluff and get to the point that holds the audience’s attention. It’s about identifying the “bear” in your narrative—the moment of crisis or opportunity—and beginning your story just before that. This method works in various contexts: Q&amp;A sessions, pitches, team meetings, and even sales conversations. I find this approach extremely effective, as it quickly captures attention and sustains interest.\nApplicability in Different Contexts\nWhether you’re presenting a business proposal or sharing an anecdote in a casual conversation, this concept applies. When you make the main point or action the focal point of your narrative, you immediately grab your listeners’ attention, allowing for a more compelling and memorable story.\nWhy This Matters\nI’ve seen firsthand the dramatic difference this makes in engagement. When you start at the point of highest interest, the chances are much higher that your audience will stay engaged until the end. This isn’t just a tactic; it’s a philosophy of communication that prioritizes the listener’s engagement and curiosity.\nKey Takeaway\nCraft your narrative in a way that starts with the most critical moment—essentially, right before you would metaphorically get “eaten by the bear.” It creates a sense of urgency and importance, ensuring that your message is not just heard, but also felt and remembered.\n\nRead more at: Wes Kao — Start right before you get eaten by the bear: How to avoid backstory scope creep\nYou may also be interested in: Cinema as a Ritual- A Reflection on Directorial Influence"},"Notes/The-Art-of-Patient-Creation":{"title":"The Art of Patient Creation","links":["Creativity-is-combinatorial"],"tags":["creativity","patience","learning","sharing"],"content":"The journey of creation is akin to a form of magic, one that unfolds in its own time and rhythm.

It’s about honoring the time it takes to nurture ideas, refine them, and finally, share them with the world. It’s a dance with time, where each step is a learning opportunity, a chance to grow and evolve. Rubin’s excitement to share his book resonates with my own excitement for every piece of content I create and share.\nI’ve come to understand that while the path to completion can be long and winding, it’s also strewn with moments of everyday mystery and wonder.

As illuminated in the podcast “Rick Rubin — Magic, Everyday Mystery, and Getting Creative,” the key to a lasting practice lies not in grand, sweeping changes but in the small, manageable steps that align with individual comfort and ease. This mirrors my own approach in coaching, where I advocate for incremental, achievable actions as the cornerstone of a consistent health regimen.\nIt’s a philosophy rooted in the understanding that the grandeur of ambition often needs to be tempered by the practicality of action. Starting with what is easy and comfortable forms a foundation strong enough to support the weight of more challenging goals. This approach ensures that the journey to health and fitness is not a sprint filled with unsustainable efforts, but a marathon marked by steady, enduring progress.\nIn my experience, the simplicity of an action directly correlates to its longevity.

When I read about Airbnb’s first slide deck used to pitch venture capitalists, I was reminded that clarity and conciseness are key. Essentially, every pitch should touch on two pivotal aspects: the problem you’re solving and how you intend to solve it. It seems simple, but these foundational elements are often buried under unnecessary complexity.\nSimplicity is key. Airbnb’s success wasn’t just down to a groundbreaking idea; it was also how they presented that idea. In essence, their pitch could be distilled into a straightforward narrative: the problem of expensive or unavailable lodging and their solution of a peer-to-peer service for people to list, discover, and book accommodations.\nTo be clear, it’s not just about simplifying; it’s about focusing on what really matters. Are we solving a real problem? How unique or effective is our solution? It forces you to distill your thoughts, to practice communicating complex ideas in easily understandable terms. And the more you practice, the better you get. It’s not a one-off task but a continuous process of refining and mastering the skill.\nThis is an essential practice in my book—whether you’re seeking venture capital, pushing for a project at work, or simply trying to solve a problem in your community. Because, let’s be honest, nobody gets far by being misunderstood. So keep practicing, keep refining.

The implication is stark and clear: simplifying our informational landscape can be a low-cost, high-impact approach to enhancing safety.\nThis extends beyond traffic signs to a broader principle: solutions can be double-edged swords, and our intuition about their effectiveness is not infallible. In the fitness realm, for instance, the allure of flashy, complex regimens may eclipse the effectiveness of simple, consistent workouts. The challenge lies in recognizing when our strategies, no matter how innovative or exciting, fail to hit the mark—and having the humility to pivot away from them.\n\nRead more at: The Christmas Tree Effect - by David Epstein - Range Widely\nYou may also be interested in: Creative problem problem solving is like improv"},"Notes/The-Courage-to-Love-Imperfectly":{"title":"The Courage to Love Imperfectly","links":["Maps/Spirituality-MOC","Notes/Focusing-on-Meaningful-Movement"],"tags":["relationships","personal-growth","emotional-intelligence","vulnerability"],"content":"The quest for love often gets tangled in the illusion of perfection. We’re led to believe that the ideal partner is flawless, a paragon of virtues with no room for human error. But this is a mirage. The reality is that we’re all flawed beings, each with our own set of quirks, insecurities, and emotional complexities.\nIn my own coaching practice and life, I often emphasize the courage it takes to love someone who is as flawed as you are. The beauty of love lies not in perfection but in the willingness to grow together, to poke and prod at each other’s vulnerabilities, and to emerge stronger for it. It’s about finding someone who’s scarred and bruised, just like you, and offering to help each other heal and grow.\nThis is the good stuff—the marrow of meaningful relationships. It’s not about finding someone who completes you, but someone who complements you, who challenges you, and who’s willing to build with you, scars and all.\nSo, the next time you find yourself seeking perfection in love, remember that you’re not perfect either. And that’s okay. In fact, it’s more than okay; it’s the foundation upon which real, lasting love is built.\n\nRead more at: no good alone - by rayne fisher-quann - internet princess\nGo one level up : Spirituality MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Focusing on Meaningful Movement"},"Notes/The-Creator's-Dilemma--Authenticity-vs.-Trends":{"title":"The Creator's Dilemma: Authenticity vs. Trends","links":["Maps/Creator-Economy-MOC","Notes/The-Art-of-Being--Why-Comparison-is-the-Thief-of-Joy"],"tags":["authenticity","social-dynamics","creator-economy","personal-brand"],"content":"The creator game is a complex landscape of social dynamics, persuasion, and competition. It’s easy to get swept up in the collective mania of trends, especially when other creators loudly proclaim the importance of certain tactics or platforms. But here’s the kicker: often, these proclamations stem from their own insecurities. They’re shouting to drown out their own doubts.\nIn my own journey, I’ve realized that the most sustainable path is to be authentically yourself. Sure, you can adopt successful strategies from others, but only to a point. The moment you start to lose sight of why you entered this space—to share your unique insights, skills, or art—that’s when you veer off course.\nThe creator path is not the default path. You didn’t choose it to become a carbon copy of someone else. You chose it to write, create videos, build software, or in my case, to coach and inspire people to live healthier lives. The essence of your work should be a reflection of your unique relationship to it. Everything else is just noise.\nSo, how do you navigate this? By engaging deeply with your work and constantly re-evaluating your strategies. Are they aligned with your authentic self? If not, it’s time to pivot.

But what if, instead of making people hunt for healthier options, we make nutritious, delicious, and affordable food the default? Here’s the kicker: healthy meals don’t need a prescription, they need a platform— an economic and social one.\nUnpacking the Economic Nuances\nWhile individual effort can’t be discounted, the collective endeavor carries far more weight. Why? Because not everyone has the time or resources to sift through myriad food choices. We often say ‘food is medicine,’ but we don’t make it as readily available as a fast-food burger. It’s almost like we’ve designed a game that’s rigged against the player.\nI often find myself entangled in the “food as medicine” narrative in my coaching practice. But it’s not about creating a medicalized food culture; it’s about making the healthy choice the easy choice. That way, I don’t have to convince my clients to seek out quinoa when it’s right there next to the fries. It should be a national effort to tip the scales in favor of good health.\nZooming Out: It’s More Than Just Food\nWe’re not going to overhaul the entire food system overnight, but even a small shift can create a butterfly effect. Making nutritious food the default not only addresses public health but also feeds into a more sustainable, ethical food system. It realigns our collective mindset from “food as a commodity” to “food as a community.”\nWhy This Matters\nAffordability and accessibility can no longer be the unique selling propositions of junk food. We need to inject these virtues into nutritious food options as well.

Kahneman describes his own experience of being embroiled in critiques, replies, and rejoinders, painting a picture of academic disputes as exhausting and rife with sarcasm.\nWe’ve been socialized to think that controversy and debate are engines of progress, especially in scientific fields. While this can be true to some extent, it’s worth noting—as Kahneman does—that such debates often devolve into contests, aimed at personal humiliation rather than collective enlightenment. I can’t help but think how easily things become personal and descend into ad hominem attacks. The aim shifts from proving a point to discrediting the opponent.\nFor me, this serves as a cautionary tale. Intellectual pursuits shouldn’t be about inflating egos or displaying one’s intellectual might; they should be about the relentless pursuit of truth. It’s a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, you want to invite challenge to refine your thinking, as discussed in the previous note on “adversarial collaboration.” But on the other hand, you want to avoid the pitfalls of embroiling yourself in a never-ending cycle of critique and rebuttal that gets you nowhere.\nI must admit, this insight challenges my view on the infallibility of academic discourse. It leads me to ask: How do we sustain the integrity and utility of academic debates, while avoiding the traps that Kahneman describes? It’s something worth pondering as we navigate the complexities of intellectual growth and scientific progress.\n\nRead more at: Adversarial Collaboration: An EDGE Lecture by Daniel Kahneman | Edge.org\nYou may also be interested in: Navigating the Metagame- Lessons from Academia to Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Intellectual-Ambition":{"title":"The Double-Edged Sword of Intellectual Ambition","links":["Notes/We-think-humility-is-putting-yourself-down"],"tags":["leadership","critical-thinking","self-awareness","ambition"],"content":"While intellectual humility is often praised as a virtue, it can sometimes be a crutch that prevents us from striving for greater insights. The notion that the best thinkers and builders are not just intellectually humble, but also intellectually ambitious, suggests that we should not merely hold opinions tentatively but actively seek out transformative ideas worth standing by.\nWhen I examine my own approach, I notice that humility can serve as a comfortable facade. It keeps the ego in check, yes, but it can also limit one’s willingness to take the intellectual leaps required to be truly groundbreaking. It’s not about recklessness; it’s about calculated audacity.\nThere’s a tension between caution and ambition that’s worth exploring. Caution might keep us from making grave mistakes, but it may also keep us from the game-changing bets that could redefine our fields, or our lives. This is particularly apparent in the concept of “superforecasters,” whose modus operandi often emphasizes caution and tentativeness. While this cautious approach has merits, it may miss out on the psychological willpower required to stick with bold visions.\nThis raises a pivotal question: can you be both humble and ambitious? I think the answer lies in what you’re ambitious about. If your ambition is toward gaining a deeper, nuanced understanding and making a meaningful impact, then that’s a form of ambition worth pursuing. However, if it’s about proving yourself right at all costs, then that’s where the danger lies.\nSo, if you find yourself leaning too heavily on intellectual humility, consider recalibrating your mindset. Honor the work that achieving real knowledge demands and embrace it as a path to a life fully and consciously lived. After all, it’s those bets worth making that often lead to the most fulfilling outcomes.\n\nRead more at: Intellectual Humility Is a Cop-out\nYou may also be interested in: We think humility is putting yourself down"},"Notes/The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Optimization-Metrics":{"title":"The Double-Edged Sword of Optimization Metrics","links":["Maps/Body-MOC","Notes/Overoptimizing-Burning-out-and-working-out"],"tags":["psychology","optimization","health-metrics","measurement","perception"],"content":"In the age of data-driven everything, the allure of optimization is hard to resist. From sleep scores to workout metrics, we’re inundated with numbers that promise to quantify our well-being. But what if these numbers are not just reflective but also directive, influencing how we actually feel?\nConsider the “nocebo” effect, the evil twin of the placebo effect. While a placebo can make you feel better through positive expectations, a nocebo can make you feel worse through negative ones. If you wake up to a sub-par sleep score, your day might already feel ruined, regardless of how you actually slept. It’s a compelling example of how psychology can override physiology.\nThis is a cautionary tale for those of us in the health and fitness industry. While metrics can be incredibly useful, they can also be misleading or even harmful. It’s like hiking with a GPS that sometimes leads you off the trail. Sure, it’s mostly reliable, but when it’s not, you could end up lost or, worse, in danger.\nSo, the next time you’re tempted to obsess over a score or metric, remember that your perception of that number can be as impactful as the number itself. It’s not just about the data; it’s about how the data makes you feel. And sometimes, the healthiest choice might be to ignore the numbers and listen to your body instead.\nThis resonates with me because I’ve seen how the psychology of metrics can impact not just performance but also self-perception. A good score can boost your confidence, but a bad one can do the opposite, even if it’s not an accurate reflection of your well-being.\n\nRead more at: The Case Against Optimizing - by Brady Holmer\nGo one level up : Body MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Overoptimizing Burning out and working out"},"Notes/The-Double-Edged-Sword-of-Shared-Behaviors-in-Relationships":{"title":"The Double-Edged Sword of Shared Behaviors in Relationships","links":["Notes/Coaching-Health-is-a-positive-sum-game"],"tags":["relationships","health-choices","health","emotional-regulation","emotions","behavioral-dynamics","behavioral-psychology"],"content":"It’s intriguing to consider how shared behaviors between partners may serve dual roles in a relationship. On one hand, engaging in certain habits together—like unwinding with a glass of wine or splurging on desserts—may promote emotional closeness or resolve tension. These actions, seemingly problematic, often serve to sustain or enhance various aspects of the relationship in the short term.\nBut here’s the twist: such behaviors, especially when they become routine, can have detrimental effects on individual health. For instance, couples who use eating as an emotional cushion may find their health compromised over time. I’ve often noticed how behaviors, even bad ones, become embedded in a relationship’s dynamics, unknowingly impacting our well-being. The study from “Let’s Enjoy an Evening on the Couch?” validates this insight, linking shared problematic behaviors like an unhealthy diet or excessive drinking to larger health concerns like an increase in BMI.\nFrom a coaching perspective, it might be worth it to steer conversations toward understanding not just the individual’s habits but also the context of those habits within their relationships. While our choices play a significant role, the person we choose as a partner can drastically amplify or mitigate the impact of those choices on our health.\nIn light of this, I’m convinced more than ever that our choices in a relationship don’t just affect emotional well-being; they also resonate loudly in our health metrics. To put it simply: your choice of a life partner is also a health partner in disguise. And that’s not to be taken lightly.\nSo next time you engage in a shared ‘bad habit’, maybe pause and think: is this serving us in the long term, or is it just a short-term fix?\n\nRead more at: Let’s Enjoy an Evening on the Couch?

On the one hand, the “Paradox of Abundance” looms large: a phenomenon where the sheer volume of available information turns from a benefit into a burden. While we have the privilege of accessing lectures from the brightest minds ever to exist—literally at our fingertips—we also have to sift through an endless barrage of trivial content that adds little value to our lives. How bizarre is it that one can seamlessly switch from watching a life-changing TED Talk to zoning out with mindless internet fights?\nIt’s tempting to view this ocean of data as purely a treasure trove of wisdom waiting to be unearthed. But let’s not kid ourselves. The paradox lies in the fact that this abundance often leads to information overload. We get so bombarded with data that it becomes a task in itself to find what’s genuinely valuable. This overload often leads to a state of decision paralysis, freezing us in our tracks instead of motivating us to grow. It’s akin to standing at the edge of an infinite library but not knowing which book to pick up.\nNow, you might ask, “How do we navigate this labyrinth of information without getting lost?” It’s not about being a passive consumer; it’s about becoming a discerning participant in this digital ecosystem. We need to be agile curators of our own content diets, cherry-picking what truly enriches us and consciously avoiding the mind-numbing noise.\nThis resonates with my own experiences because, as someone knee-deep in the world of coaching and self-improvement, I see how easy it is for people to drown in resources without making any real progress. Imagine a symphony of influences, all playing at the same time. The art lies in conducting this symphony so that it plays your life’s theme song, not a cacophony of random notes. And yes, let’s not forget, even in a symphony, some silence is golden. Sometimes, unplugging is the best way to plug into what really matters.\nRecognizing and addressing the “Paradox of Abundance” in this digital age is more than just an intellectual exercise. It’s a necessity for mental clarity, focused growth, and ultimately, a fulfilling life.\n\nRead more at: The Paradox of Abundance - David Perell\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Economics of Abundance- How Technology Defies Scarcity"},"Notes/The-Economics-of-Abundance--How-Technology-Defies-Scarcity":{"title":"The Economics of Abundance- How Technology Defies Scarcity","links":["Maps/Social-Sciences-MOC","Notes/A-vision-of-the-creator-economy-that-works"],"tags":["technology","scarcity","resources","innovation","economics","work"],"content":"The statement that “nitrogen doesn’t cost anything” might raise eyebrows, especially for those of us who understand that even air isn’t “free” in a polluted city. What the author likely means is that when a resource is abundant and easily accessible, its cost tends to be negligible. However, this overlooks the costs associated with extraction, refinement, and distribution.\nThe crux of the matter is the transformative power of technology to shift the economics of scarcity. Think about it: centuries ago, salt was a precious commodity. Now, it’s so cheap and abundant that we scatter it on icy roads. The same could be said for information in the digital age. Once confined to libraries and scholars, it’s now virtually free and at our fingertips.\nIn the realm of health and fitness, this principle is a game-changer. Advanced technologies could make personalized medicine or tailored fitness programs more accessible, reducing the “cost” of optimal health. Imagine a future where AI-driven health coaching is as ubiquitous and affordable as a Google search.\nBut there’s a flip side. As technology makes resources abundant, it also has the potential to make some skills and jobs obsolete. It’s a double-edged sword that requires thoughtful navigation.\nSo, while the concept of “infinite intelligence” solving most problems is enticing, it’s not a magic wand. It’s a tool that, when wielded wisely, can create abundance out of scarcity, but also demands a new kind of literacy to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape\n\nRead more at: Infinite Intelligence - by Tomas Pueyo\nGo one level up : Social Sciences MOC\nYou may also be interested in: A vision of the creator economy that works"},"Notes/The-Effects-of-Social-Isolation-in-Sport":{"title":"The Effects of Social Isolation in Sport","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://thesportjournal.org/article/covid-19-social-isolation-and-optimism-in-sport/"},"Notes/The-Efficiency-Paradox--Work-Less,-Achieve-More":{"title":"The Efficiency Paradox: Work Less, Achieve More","links":["Notes/The-efficiency-of-slacking-off"],"tags":["work-efficiency","work","content-strategy","high-impact"],"content":"The Big-Idea-Centric Approach\nTraditional wisdom often tells us that the more we work, the more we accomplish.

Quality trumps quantity. The idea is to create content that resonates, not just fills space.\nRepurposing: The Magic Wand of Efficiency\nOnce you’ve nailed those impactful pieces of content, repurpose them. A great tweet can become an Instagram caption, a LinkedIn post, or even a slide in a presentation. This tactic aligns closely with my ongoing efforts to build an efficient system for my health coaching practice. Why reinvent the wheel when you can multiply the impact of a single, well-crafted message?\nThe True Value of Working Less\nThe key takeaway here is not to work less for the sake of laziness but to work smarter. By focusing your efforts on tasks that truly matter and have the most impact, you not only save time but also increase the quality of your output.\nWhy It Matters\nIn the age of information overload and constant hustle, adopting a minimal but impactful work strategy can differentiate you from the crowd.

One moment you’re on a high because your child took a bite of broccoli, and the next, you’re plummeting because they’ve decided that crackers are the only food group that matters.\nAs a parent, it’s easy to internalize these ups and downs as personal successes or failures. However, it’s crucial to remember that you’re not in this alone. The task of instilling good eating habits in a child is a collective endeavor, much like building a house. You may lay the foundation, but you need architects, builders, and interior designers—in the form of partners, family, and the broader environment—to complete the structure.\nModeling good habits is like being the site manager on this construction project. You set the tone and direction, but you also collaborate with others to ensure the project’s success. The podcast episode serves as a reminder that experts in the field, like Dr. Becky Kennedy and Megan McNamee, can act as valuable consultants, offering strategies and insights that can make the process less stressful and more effective.\nSo, the next time you find yourself on that emotional rollercoaster, remember: it’s not just your ride.

This perspective suggests that we must make sacrifices, either personally or professionally, to achieve success in the other realm.\nHowever, contrary to this ‘zero-sum game’ view of energy management, emerging research and personal experience suggest that our energy isn’t necessarily finite. In fact, it can be quite the opposite; investing time and effort in activities that are genuinely invigorating can actually recharge our mental batteries. The game-changer here is to identify these ‘energy-giving’ activities or tasks and then intentionally interweave them into both our personal and professional commitments.\nI’ve realized that it’s not about having a reserve of energy that depletes; it’s more about channeling it in ways that serve us. If something piques your interest or makes you feel engaged, it’s not going to ‘cost’ you energy but will rather refuel your internal engines. This shift in focus is not so much a depletion but a recalibration of where our mental resources are most effectively utilized.\nTherefore, the real question we should be asking ourselves is not how to conserve energy, but rather where can we create synergies? Is there a passion project or hobby that excites you and could also add value to your work? Or perhaps a skill you need to acquire for professional reasons that could also be useful in your personal life?

Echoing Simone Weil’s contemplations, taste is the ability to attend to what truly matters, to distinguish not just with the mind but with the soul. It is a vigilant process of exploration—of turning every stone with intention, focus, and care.\nThis dedication to depth brings to light the reality that taste is multifaceted and often compartmentalized. One may possess an exquisite sense for the visual arts yet find contentment in the simplest of pleasures elsewhere. It’s a poignant reminder that taste, in each of its forms, requires a specific kind of attention.\nDrawing upon John Folley’s wisdom, we see that ‘good taste’ transcends mere preference, reaching for the realms of the Good and the True. It’s a moral taste, where our choices are not only well-informed but aligned with the virtues of our reality.\nIn the spirit of Weil, true attention in taste is to be present with each choice, each preference, and each inclination, ensuring they resonate with our core values and truths. It’s an active engagement that refines our being and elevates our interactions with the world.\nThus, good taste becomes a symphony of discernment, morality, and attention, where the beauty of our choices reflects the depth of our understanding.\n\nRead more at: Fetching Title#w76p\nYou may also be interested in: Attention For Simone Weil"},"Notes/The-F.A.T.-Formula-for-Thought-Leadership--A-Personal-Reflection":{"title":"The F.A.T.

It’s akin to having a well-stocked library but keeping it locked away from the public. What good is knowledge if it’s not shared openly?\nThe concept of “escape velocity” is intriguing. It’s the point where you’ve gained enough momentum in two distinct streams that you can create something entirely new. Think of Scott Adams, who blended business acumen with cartooning to create a unique voice. It’s like hiking two different trails and discovering a hidden path that connects them, offering a new perspective that only you can provide.\nFor me, the challenge lies in being more transparent about my learnings and experiences. Transparency isn’t just about openness; it’s about vulnerability. It’s about sharing not just the polished final product but also the messy, complicated process that led to it. This is where I need to focus my efforts.\nThis matters to me because I realize that authority without transparency is like a locked treasure chest. The value is there, but it’s not fully accessible. To truly achieve “escape velocity” and create something of unique value, I need to embrace transparency as much as I’ve embraced authority.\n\nRead more at: You’re a pro.

The case of US News rankings exemplifies how these numbers can dominate the public conversation and shape individual decisions. The problem? These rankings can be incredibly misleading and easily manipulated. Just look at the case of Columbia University. After the Thaddeus exposé came to light, their rankings plummeted. But what does that actually mean for the institution or its students?\nAs someone who’s all too familiar with the pitfalls of obsessing over metrics in my coaching business, I understand the inherent flaws in such ranking systems. They offer a simplified representation of what’s actually a complex set of variables. You can game the system, make yourself or your organization look good on paper, but at what cost? Just like in health and fitness, there are no shortcuts to excellence.\nThe public’s fixation on these numbers, fueled by posts and tweets that go viral, perpetuates a cycle of misinformation. For instance, when medical schools started pulling away from the US rankings, it was celebrated as if a grand illusion had been dispelled. Yet, the obsession persists. The paradox is that while many decry these rankings, we’re also the ones responsible for their prominence. Whether it’s colleges or any other institution, the critical question should be, “Are we measuring what actually matters?”\nThe true absurdity of this situation is that we let numbers dictate how we feel about an entire establishment. I’m a proponent of metrics, but let’s use them wisely and in context, especially if they have far-reaching implications. The story of Columbia is a cautionary tale, and it shows that it’s high time we rethink how we evaluate success.\n\nRead more at: The Pushkin Prize for Egregiously Deceptive Self-Promotion | Revisionist History\nYou may also be interested in: Navigating the Metagame- Lessons from Academia to Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/The-Fast-Foodification-of-Everything":{"title":"The Fast-Foodification of Everything","links":["Maps/Culture-MOC","Notes/Find-a-group-where-your-desired-culture-exists"],"tags":["culture","sameness","community","group-confidence"],"content":"This has to do with the copy &amp; paste effect.

It’s not the physical borders that we cross but the internal boundaries—constrained by societal norms, familial expectations, and self-imposed limitations—that truly expand. The article “On Travel, Living Abroad &amp; Losing Your Self” paints an intriguing notion about third culture adults. What struck me is that these individuals have “disconnected from their own default paths” and exist in a state of “lack of legibility.”\nI’m nodding my head vigorously as I read this. I’ve always felt that I’m a bit of a cultural hybrid, zigzagging between worlds and not fully belonging to any. There’s freedom in such an existence. Third culture adults are like will-o’-the-wisps, illuminating paths not typically seen, existing in the murky territories between societal containers. No, we aren’t this or that, but an amalgamation of experiences, thoughts, and contradictions.\nRemember those puzzling questions like, “What’s bad about changing?” and “What’s good about not changing?” from earlier musings? They fit like a glove here. Third culture living is a conscious choice to step away from dichotomous thinking. We don’t neatly fit into societal “somebody containers,” and why should we? Those containers limit perspective, confine growth, and let’s be honest, they are boring! We’d rather be a multitude, a labyrinth of experiences and thoughts.\nThe beauty is in giving others the space to be confusing, to be a myriad of things without needing to “understand” them in the traditional sense. That’s like choosing to enjoy a complex piece of art without needing to dissect every brush stroke. You appreciate it for what it is—a confluence of contradictions, a palette of emotions, and an ever-changing spectacle.\nAnd there’s a certain resonance with the idea of hormesis here: a bit of stress, a bit of dissonance, a bit of contradiction—all these make us more resilient and open-minded. I find it exhilarating to be part of a community that not only accepts but celebrates these facets.

It’s a testament to the idea that mastery begins with the basics—the ‘how’ of even the smallest actions can be a precursor to the ‘why’ of grand achievements. Wooden’s approach echoes a broader, almost biblical wisdom: those who tend to the vines of the trivial with care may indeed be trusted with the weightier vineyards of life. There’s a magic in the mundane, an everyday mystery to be unraveled in the pursuit of greatness, suggesting that the path to larger victories is paved with the bricks of these tiny, deliberate acts.\nIn embracing this philosophy, I recognize that the attention I pay to the trivialities is not just about the act itself but about setting a standard for everything I undertake.

One might think this is only relevant for techies or marketers, but the ripple effects will surely reach health coaching as well. How? Let’s consider a few things.\nFirstly, AI is not just changing how people search; it’s changing what they find. Generic glossary terms or FAQs about health, wellness, and exercise are likely to be auto-generated by AI, replacing the traditional search results. This presents a challenge but also an opportunity for health coaches.\nGrowth hacking our way through this new landscape will require a shift in approach. No more flowery language to fill the page. The content needs to be straight to the point, with shorter paragraphs and lists to facilitate easy digestion—no pun intended.\nWhat’s more, highlighting key elements such as contact details or special offers becomes even more critical. These are the “expiration dates” and “phone numbers” of the health coaching world. In this digital age, your online presence isn’t just a business card; it’s a living, breathing entity that needs to adapt, or risk being replaced by a machine.\nAnd here’s the kicker from my own musings: AI’s role in transforming searches can either be a threat or a tool. If we understand its mechanisms, we can not just adapt, but get ahead of it. By adding a personal touch to our services—something AI can’t replicate—we could give ourselves a competitive edge.\n\nRead more at: An AI-enabled health coach may be in your future\nYou may also be interested in: CROSS"},"Notes/The-Gap-Between-Reality-and-Possibility":{"title":"The Gap Between Reality and Possibility","links":["Maps/Self-Improvement-MOC","Notes/Most-people-do-want-to-use-their-bodies-as-laboratories-for-self-improvement"],"tags":["performance","potential","self-improvement","coaching"],"content":"Performance is a moving target, a spectrum with complacency at one end and peak potential at the other. When I think about how I’m doing, there’s always this nagging question—am I truly giving it my all? Have I reached my full potential or am I stuck on a plateau?\nThis is the “delta” that Dr. Julie Gurner talks about—the gap between how we’re performing and the potential for our performance. It’s a healthy space to dwell in mentally because it guards against stagnation. It also holds a mirror up to our limitations, offering a window into what we could become.\nComplacency is the enemy of greatness. Like sitting in a warm bath until the water turns cold, it lulls us into a false sense of contentment. But that delta? It’s a constant poke in the side, a reminder that we could be doing more, being more.\nLet’s take this idea to the gym for a moment. Think of exercise as a form of performance. If you’re lifting the same weight every time you go to the gym, are you really growing? The body craves variation, challenge, stress even, to evolve.\nIn the context of coaching, this delta concept offers an interesting tool. It’s not just about helping people perform better but about helping them to envision a more expansive version of themselves. This perspective promotes not just the attainment of goals but the constant recalibration of those goals. A moving target is harder to hit, but it’s also more rewarding when you do.\nNow, if you excuse me, I need to reevaluate some of my own targets. There’s a delta waiting to be narrowed.\nNote: Remember, this concept is vital but not a standalone solution. The idea of this ‘delta’ can be an effective motivator, but it has to be integrated within a larger framework of self-improvement and wellness strategies. And yes, it’s easier said than done. But hey, nobody said closing the delta was going to be easy.\n\nRead more at: Julie Gurner #169\nGo one level up : Self Improvement MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Most people do want to use their bodies as laboratories for self improvement"},"Notes/The-Gary-plan-in-schooling":{"title":"The Gary plan in schooling","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Gary plan in schooling §\nSource: §\n\n??\nThis was on a Nebula video\n\nHighlights §\n\nalso mentions that school for industrialization was a myth\nIt’s just because of Catholic schools that we have bells\n"},"Notes/The-Gift-of-Time--Experiences-with-Memory-Dividends":{"title":"The Gift of Time: Experiences with Memory Dividends","links":["Maps/Life-MOC","Notes/The-Investment-Portfolio-of-Youthful-Experiences"],"tags":["gifts","experiences","memory","long-term","long-game","emotions"],"content":"Investing in Experiences: The New Wealth\nWe often approach gift-giving as a one-time transaction, focusing on the immediate joy it brings.

Specifically, experiential gifts that not only delight in the moment but continue to provide joy over time.\nAnnual Memberships &amp; More: The Long Game\nConsider an annual membership to a museum, weekly babysitting during the summer, or monthly classes. These aren’t just gifts; they’re gestures that reverberate, providing a consistent reminder of thoughtfulness. Each experience serves as an installment in a joy-portfolio that grows with time.\n1st Person Insight\nWhen I think about the concept of a “memory dividend,” it’s like you’re front-loading happiness that compounds over time. In my work as a health coach, this is parallel to investing in good health habits early on. The benefits, be it joyful memories or a healthier lifestyle, accrue over time, far outweighing the initial investment.\nThe Memory Dividend: Compounding Joy\nJust like compound interest in finance, experiences can offer a “memory dividend.” The joy derived from the experience doesn’t just stop after the event; it’s relived, shared, and even built upon. This offers a compounding effect that an object can rarely match.\nWhy This Matters\nIt’s time we reframe our approach to gift-giving and focus on long-term emotional dividends. Not only does it sustain joy for the recipient, but it also forges stronger, more meaningful connections. And in a world where material goods are often prioritized, this seems like a high-return investment we should all be making.\n\nRead more at: How to Gift Experiences Instead of Things: A Helpful Guide\nGo one level up : Life MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Investment Portfolio of Youthful Experiences"},"Notes/The-Gravity-of-Genetic-Self-Control-in-Coaching":{"title":"The Gravity of Genetic Self-Control in Coaching","links":["Maps/Health-Coaching-MOC","Notes/Coaching-Health-is-a-positive-sum-game"],"tags":["genetics","coaching","self-discipline","opportunities"],"content":"In the realm of coaching, understanding each client’s unique predisposition toward self-discipline can be likened to recognizing the inescapable force of gravity. This perspective shift encourages a focus on intelligent individualization rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\nIt’s not about labeling someone as inherently disciplined or not but about acknowledging the genetic factors that can influence one’s self-control. When a client inevitably slips—because everyone does—it’s not a setback but an opportunity. This “falling off the wagon” moment should be embraced as a learning experience for both coach and client.\nJust as you can’t change gravity, you can’t fully alter a person’s natural level of self-discipline. However, you can study its effects. Consider the environmental and social influences that may have contributed to the lapse. What preventive measures could have minimized the need for raw self-control?

Contrary to what we might wish to believe, “winging it” in the realm of thought incurs more than just a financial toll—it can cost us opportunities, relationships, and even our well-being. As the saying goes, “Good thinking is expensive, bad thinking costs a fortune.”\nIt’s not enough to allocate mere fragments of time and attention to thinking. A piecemeal approach lacks depth, failing to dissect the intricacies of a problem or idea. On the contrary, forcing ourselves to make our thoughts visible through writing acts as a stringent accountability measure. Just as my friend Seki enlightened me, writing acts as a mirror, reflecting the clarity—or fog—of our thoughts back at us. And let’s be honest: poor thinking can’t escape the scrutiny of the written word.\nCommitting thoughts to paper is transformative. Good writing, by its very nature, mandates good thinking. You don’t “get the gist” and translate that into eloquent prose—it’s more symbiotic than that. Writing serves as both a catalyzer and a filter, accelerating the solidification of nebulous ideas while sieving out the chaff. Therefore, don’t skimp on cognitive investment; the ROI on clear, well-articulated ideas is virtually immeasurable.\nSo next time you find yourself grappling with a complex problem or abstract concept, don’t just skim the surface.

This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a crisis that I see unfolding in my own community in the Philippines.\nThe Myth of Subsistence Farming\nContrary to popular belief, rural communities in places like Africa aren’t primarily relying on subsistence farming. They’re also consuming processed foods, including highly processed ones. This dispels the notion that eating healthy is merely a matter of choice or effort. The food landscape is more complex and fraught with challenges than we often acknowledge.\nThe Volatility of Food Prices\nFarmers and rural populations are more exposed to food price volatility and hunger than previously thought. This isn’t just an issue for consumers; it’s a systemic problem that affects the entire food supply chain.

This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a crisis that I see unfolding in my own community in the Philippines.\nThe Myth of Subsistence Farming\nContrary to popular belief, rural communities in places like Africa aren’t primarily relying on subsistence farming. They’re also consuming processed foods, including highly processed ones. This dispels the notion that eating healthy is merely a matter of choice or effort. The food landscape is more complex and fraught with challenges than we often acknowledge.\nThe Volatility of Food Prices\nFarmers and rural populations are more exposed to food price volatility and hunger than previously thought.

Recent data from a Deloitte study suggests that the narrative is, sadly, not far from the truth. Yet, as daunting as these figures may sound, they actually unveil a lucrative silver lining for health coaches and well-being entrepreneurs.\nConsider this: only about a third of workers experienced improved health year-over-year, while a staggering 40% found themselves in toxic work settings that eroded their mental, physical, or social well-being. On the flip side, 60% of employees are ready to jump ship for a company that puts their health first. This points to an untapped well of demand for health-focused initiatives in the workplace.\nHere’s where it gets personal for me. If ever there was a time for health coaching to shine, it’s now. A rising wave of health consciousness is intersecting with a labor market that’s screaming for solutions. I see this as nothing short of a goldmine. Businesses are increasingly aware that investing in employee wellness isn’t just ethical—it’s smart economics.\nImagine this as a Venn diagram where one circle is ‘Employee Desires for Better Health’ and the other is ‘Employer Need for Productivity and Retention.’ At the intersection lies a sweet spot of mutually beneficial outcomes—akin to striking oil in a barren land.\nIn essence, the call for a better work-life balance isn’t just a feel-good mantra; it’s an evolving market. Health coaches are essentially the drillers of this new oil. Our role? To help both employees and employers hit that sweet spot of well-being that elevates all aspects of life.\nThis is far from a zero-sum game. It’s an ecosystem waiting to be balanced, and for those who are able to do so, the rewards are manifold.\n\nRead more at: Issue No. 241: No Days Off | Fitt Insider\nGo one level up : Health Coaching MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Navigating the Labyrinth of Mind Traps"},"Notes/The-High-Cost-of-Transferred-Autonomy--When-Financial-Responsibility-Becomes-a-Family-Affair":{"title":"The High Cost of Transferred-Autonomy: When Financial Responsibility Becomes a Family Affair","links":["Notes/Health-and-Freedom"],"tags":["family-dynamics","autonomy","personal-finance","responsibility"],"content":"The notion that money is merely a tool for personal growth takes on a whole new dimension when you factor in family responsibilities. When you’re solo, contentment with little is far easier to attain. I know this first hand; the stakes were much lower, and the freedom to choose my lifestyle wasn’t weighed down by the needs and wants of others.\nEnter the concept of “transferred-autonomy” - the balancing act of financial decision-making that doesn’t just affect you, but those you’re responsible for. Money then becomes not just fuel for personal desires, but a resource that could potentially make or break the well-being of your loved ones. The paradox here is that while you could personally be very content with less, that contentment gets tested when you’re responsible for others. Now, a simple lifestyle isn’t just about you but involves the well-being and future of your family.\nTake, for example, the idealistic 20-something who could thrive on minimalism, living out of a backpack. Fast forward a couple of decades, and you might find the same person grappling with mortgages, school fees, and the healthcare of their dependents. The “cost” here isn’t just financial; it’s emotional and psychological as well.\nIt’s easy to maintain your financial philosophies when you’re the only stakeholder. But when other lives hinge on your financial decisions, it feels like an entirely different game. The weights on the scale have changed, and so has the cost of every decision you make. The challenge becomes how to manage financial goals and family responsibilities without sacrificing too much of your own autonomy.\nSo, money might fuel our personal ambitions, but its role drastically shifts when you have a family. It’s not just about what money can do for you, but also about what it needs to do for the people you love. And that has its own price tag, one that often extends beyond the bank account.\n\nRead more at: The Levers That Money Can’t Pull\nYou may also be interested in: Health and Freedom"},"Notes/The-High-Income-Skills-Symphony-in-Modern-Entrepreneurship":{"title":"The High-Income Skills Symphony in Modern Entrepreneurship","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","Notes/Toxic-Positivity-and-Entrepreneurship"],"tags":["entrepreneurship","skills","branding","audience"],"content":"Contrary to the popular belief that mastering a single skill is enough, the reality is more nuanced—especially for entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

Sales, branding, content creation, and design are all part of the same dance, and the best performers know all the moves.\n\n\nCareer Gymnastics: Whether it’s freelancing or joining someone else’s empire, consider it as an internship for your future self. Here, the currency isn’t just money; it’s experience.\n\n\nDaily Homage to Growth: Just like how a musician dedicates time to scales and compositions, dedicate at least an hour a day to ‘your own thing.’ Growth isn’t an accident; it’s a ritual.\n\n\nEcosystem Expansion: As your influence grows, so should your offerings.

Acknowledging when we’re merely treading water—listless, languishing, and far from “killing it”—is the very admission that keeps us anchored in integrity.\nThe self-deception spiral is a silent saboteur of progress. It reminds me of the story of Chicago therapists, a tale where the shadow of dishonesty in an honesty-based toll system cast a long pall over their patients’ recovery. It’s a stark reminder that the untruths we nurture within invariably seep into our external world, often with unforeseen consequences.\nFor me, it is evident that self-honesty is not merely a moral choice but a strategic one. By confronting our own fabrications, we can break free from self-imposed shackles and foster an environment where genuine healing and growth can flourish.

It’s impossible for me to ignore the 2021 study highlighting that an overwhelming majority of female participants felt obligated to conform to societal beauty norms. And more concerning is the 90% who admitted to using filters or editing tools to present an “ideal” image. It’s a distorted reality, not just for the viewer but also for the one posting.\nThe unsettling fact that people only recognize manipulated images 60% of the time, according to a 2017 study, signals a growing disconnect between reality and the virtual world. It’s a problem that I firmly believe won’t correct itself through market forces alone. Without some form of oversight or regulation, the gap between real and ‘Instagram real’ is only going to widen.\nThis isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s a mental health issue. The constant pressure to adhere to an unattainable standard can have severe implications on self-esteem and body image, leading to a vicious cycle of digital manipulation and mental stress. The whole situation needs reevaluation, both from social media platforms and from regulatory bodies.\nIn my opinion, leaving this unregulated is akin to ignoring a ticking time bomb. The mental and emotional toll is too significant to be dismissed as a mere byproduct of technological advancement. This is a social issue that demands immediate and thoughtful action.\n10 Charts That Capture How the World Is Changing\n\nRead more at: TikTok’s new face filters are alarmingly good — which could be pretty bad - The Verge\nYou may also be interested in: The Art of Body Balance in a World of Overwhelm"},"Notes/The-Illusion-of-Replacements--The-Sugar-Paradox":{"title":"The Illusion of Replacements: The Sugar Paradox","links":["Nutrition-MOC","Notes/How-to-think-about-dietary-supplements-when-you're-injured"],"tags":["nutrition","behavioral-psychology","consumer-behavior","health-trends"],"content":"The allure of replacements, particularly in the realm of nutrition, is a fascinating paradox. On one hand, we have sugar, the ubiquitous villain in the modern diet, linked to a plethora of health issues from obesity to Alzheimer’s. On the other hand, we have its alternatives—high-intensity sweeteners like monk fruit and saccharin—that promise the sweetness without the calories. Yet, these substitutes come with their own set of problems, often being hundreds of times sweeter than natural sugar and having long-term implications we’re only beginning to understand.\nThe quest for replacements, as I see it, stems from a desire to “have our cake and eat it too.” It’s a mindset that’s deeply rooted in consumer culture, where the next best thing is always just around the corner. But this constant search for a “better” alternative can be a trap. It’s like trying to fill a void with something that was never meant to fill it in the first place.\nThis reminds me of the concept of hormesis in exercise. Just as a certain amount of stress is beneficial for growth, perhaps what we need is not to eliminate sugar entirely but to find a balanced, moderate approach. The body and mind resist drastic changes for a reason; they’re wired for equilibrium.\nGen Z’s willingness to pay for multiple subscriptions to phone-based fitness content suggests that the appetite for “better” or “easier” solutions is not going away. But as a health coach, I can’t help but think that the real opportunity lies in challenging this mindset. Instead of seeking shortcuts or replacements, what if we focused on understanding the underlying behaviors and beliefs that lead us to make unhealthy choices in the first place?\nThe key takeaway here is that replacements are not the panacea they’re often made out to be. They might offer a temporary fix, but they don’t address the root of the problem. And sometimes, the quest for the “perfect” replacement can be more detrimental than the thing we’re trying to replace.\n\nRead more at: Issue No. 242: The Replacements | Fitt Insider\nGo one level up : Nutrition MOC\nYou may also be interested in: How to think about dietary supplements when you’re injured"},"Notes/The-Illusion-of-the-Magic-Morning--The-Hidden-Costs-of-Entrepreneurial-Sacrifice":{"title":"The Illusion of the Magic Morning: The Hidden Costs of Entrepreneurial Sacrifice","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","Notes/Burnout-Guide"],"tags":["entrepreneurship","health-first-entreprenuership","mythbusting","work-life-balance","patient-strategy","long-game"],"content":"Ah, the allure of the magic morning routine—waking up at 5 a.m., gulping down a green smoothie, and diving into work before the sun has even thought about rising. It’s a tantalizing idea, propagated by the pervasive “hustle culture” that seems to validate the unhealthy trade-offs many entrepreneurs make. The narrative goes something like this: “Sleep less, work more, and you’ll eventually bask in the glory of success.”\nThe reality? Not quite as picture-perfect. Let’s dismantle the myth for a moment.\nIn my own quest for success, it’s become abundantly clear that the trade-off between health and business is a precarious balance, like walking a tightrope over a pit of quicksand. It’s tempting to skip meals, abandon the exercise routine, and ignore the warning signs your body sends you—all in the name of getting ahead. But this is a dangerous game. I’ve realized that the long-term vision, that beacon of success that keeps me motivated, is predicated on the very health and well-being I risk compromising.\nConsider this: What’s the point of arriving at your dream destination only to find that you’ve left behind essential parts of yourself? Your health, interests, and well-being aren’t just side characters in your story; they’re co-stars.\nI work to recalibrate the relationship between body and business. Being an entrepreneur isn’t just about financial investment; it’s about whole-body investment. Patience is not just a virtue; it’s a strategy.

The process isn’t about perfect days but about consistent measurement and adjustment. If you’re having a bad stretch, face it head-on by reviewing the metrics. I find this approach strikingly similar to monitoring KPIs in a business. You’re not going to hit every goal every time, but you need to track consistently so you know where to adjust.\nThe author of the highlight introduces the concept of “boomerang weight,” the point at which physical changes become noticeable, and external accountability becomes a factor. Here, social support—in the form of a spouse, or even a digital community—can add an extra layer of motivation. In my line of work, this is comparable to peer reviews or mentorship; sometimes external perspectives can offer invaluable insights and added pressure to stick to your commitments.\nThen there’s the exercise. For the author, the hierarchy goes: consistency over length, and length over intensity. This framework puts daily action at the forefront. From my perspective, daily habits are akin to the daily grind of building a business. You might not see immediate results, but the cumulative effect is monumental. Much like in business, pivoting and adapting your strategy as you move along is crucial—what works during the initial stages may need adjustments later on.\nA blend of internal accountability, external support, and consistent action seems to be the magic trio for sustained weight loss.

But let’s not forget the primordial sauce of health—genuine human interaction. It’s not just good for your soul; it’s essential for your body and mind as well. A study on happiness reveals that social connectedness is linked to longer life, better physical health, and of course, happiness.\nQuality Over Quantity\nBeing socially connected doesn’t mean being socially active on digital platforms or having a large friend circle. It’s the quality of these connections that matter. Face-to-face interactions are not just an old-fashioned luxury; they are a necessity. It’s like comparing a handwritten letter to a text message. Both can convey the message, but the former carries a part of the sender’s essence.\nThink of it as a “Social Vitamin,” an essential nutrient for our well-being. Just like we need vitamin D from sun exposure, we need dopamine from real, quality human interactions. And, as a health coach, emphasizing this could be a game-changer for your clients who are looking to optimize not just their physical but also their emotional and social well-being.\nIt’s not a replacement for exercise or a balanced diet, but think of it as the seasoning that makes all the difference.

However, the article “Adversarial Collaboration: An EDGE Lecture by Daniel Kahneman” turns this notion on its head. Kahneman speaks about his experience of involving an intellectual adversary in the research process, leading to what he called the “15 IQ point benefit.”\nThe essence of adversarial collaboration lies in trusting an opponent to challenge your hypotheses rigorously. It offers an unexpected yet insightful approach to self-improvement. I’ve often found that people are generally resistant to changing their beliefs, even when presented with contradicting evidence. Kahneman explains this phenomenon as the “power of reasons being an illusion.” The true causality is reversed; we don’t believe in the reasons because they are compelling, but because we already believe in the conclusion they support.\nThis serves as a poignant reminder for me. It’s easy to fall into the trap of cognitive biases, where our perception alters the reality we want to see. The practice of adversarial collaboration provides a buffer against such biases. In essence, your intellectual adversary keeps you honest, holding up a mirror to your reasoning and its fallacies.\nThis concept is not only fascinating but useful. As someone committed to continual growth, both personally and professionally, I see the value in embracing adversarial collaboration as a tool for intellectual refinement and unbiased reasoning.

This isn’t merely an interesting piece of trivia; it reiterates the profound impact our thoughts and plans can have on seemingly automatic bodily functions like blood pressure and heartbeat. In essence, our physicality is not isolated from our mental state; they are co-dependent, feeding into and off of each other in a harmonious cycle.\nFor those who see humans as mere “brains in jars,” this serves as a reminder that our evolution has designed us to be holistic beings. Our brains are not independent processors but part of an integrated system that includes our bodies. I’ve always believed that we are not just thinking creatures; we’re also physical beings tied to our environment. This viewpoint is not just philosophical—it’s anatomical.\nIt’s a given that exercisers are familiar with how mental states can influence physical performance. But this also expands our understanding of the reciprocal relationship: how our physical state can echo back into our cognition and emotions. A stroll in nature isn’t just good for the legs; it changes the mental playlist.\nUnderstanding this interconnectedness can serve as the cornerstone for a more holistic approach to health and wellness, beyond just physical exercise or mental techniques. Because, at the end of the day, our bodies and minds are not separate realms but constituents of a single, dynamic system.\n\nRead more at: Mind-body connection is built into brain, study suggests – Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis\nYou may also be interested in: Embodied Cognition- More Than a Brain in a Jar"},"Notes/The-Introspection-Trap":{"title":"The Introspection Trap","links":["Notes/Find-a-self-reflection-process-that-works-for-you","Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/Try-Googling-the-Opposite"],"tags":["-bias-","-thinking-"],"content":"We basically think that introspection will automatically give us the answers we need, and we go for the most obvious answers — the ones that feel simple and plausible.

While hard work is important, it’s not the only metric that matters. Think of Memory Dividends as another KPI (Key Performance Indicator) for life.

Even today, this issue remains unresolved, as Susan Sontag points out. Medical professionals aren’t the only ones using metaphors that shape the experiences of cancer patients; society at large is implicated too.\nSontag coins the term “kingdom of the sick,” and I find it compelling. This metaphor serves as a societal lens through which the “well” distance themselves from the “sick,” as if they’re part of two separate, incompatible realms. If you’re diagnosed with an illness, you’re suddenly transferred to this other “kingdom,” as if stricken from the record of the well. You become “the other.”\nThe problem doesn’t just lie with medical advice from decades past. The issue has a social dimension that feeds into how patients are perceived and treated today. When you are labeled as part of the “kingdom of the sick,” you’re essentially marginalized, stripped of your former identity and cordoned off into a different societal group.\nWhile metaphors can sometimes make complex subjects more accessible, they can be equally misleading and damaging when applied inappropriately. This “kingdom” metaphor serves as a cautionary tale, making us question the terminology we unconsciously adopt and its long-term effects. Because words matter. Metaphors matter. They shape our experiences and treatment, not just of illnesses but of the people who suffer from them.\nTherefore, it’s crucial to critically evaluate our language, recognizing that it has the power to either include or marginalize, to enlighten or mislead.\n\nRead more at: Episode #178 - Transcript — Philosophize This!\nYou may also be interested in: The Problem with Using Metaphors for Mental Health and Illness"},"Notes/The-Language-of-Coaching-(Book)":{"title":"The Language of Coaching (Book)","links":["Notes/Nick-Winkelman"],"tags":[],"content":"The Language of Coaching (Book) §\nMetadata §\n\nAuthor: Nick Winkelman\nLocation: I keep related files on google drive\n"},"Notes/The-Last-Time-Always-Happens-Now":{"title":"The Last Time Always Happens Now","links":["Maps/Philosophy-MOC","Notes/Why-study-history"],"tags":["gratitude","philosophy","thinking","journaling"],"content":"For ninety-nine percent of these last times, you will have no idea that that’s what it is.

Society often equates financial status with personal worth, and the psychological toll this takes is undeniable. The fallacy that by not being wealthy, you’re somehow less valuable as a person, is corrosive. I’ve seen how this mindset can lead to a vicious cycle where financial struggles become personal failures in one’s own eyes.\nOn the flip side, money provides the liberating power to choose which problems to engage with. It offers the unique privilege of directing your attention where you want it, closing doors you prefer to remain shut and opening new ones that were previously inaccessible. Contrary to popular sentiment that “money doesn’t matter,” it certainly does. It won’t solve all your problems, but it’ll let you choose your battles. In my observation, this ability to focus attention is perhaps one of the most overlooked aspects of financial freedom.\nHowever, the irony here is that while money opens doors, it can’t fundamentally change who you are or fill the gaps in your self-worth created by societal judgments. While it can buy freedom of choice, it can’t buy self-esteem or the feeling of being enough just as you are. The key takeaway? While money is a powerful tool that can make life easier and open up choices, it’s not an elixir for deeper, existential concerns.\nSo, the question we should perhaps be asking is not just how much money we need, but what we aim to achieve with it, both materially and emotionally. Because at the end of the day, financial success is only one form of success—and there are many levers in life that money simply can’t pull.\n\nRead more at: The Levers That Money Can’t Pull\nYou may also be interested in: If you could give up half of your money now for health what would it be"},"Notes/The-Liberating-Power-of-Life's-Weirdness":{"title":"The Liberating Power of Life's Weirdness","links":["Maps/Spirituality-MOC","Notes/It's-weird-to-think-you-don't-want-to-change"],"tags":["perspective","weirdness","existential","liberation"],"content":"Life is inherently strange, unpredictable, and full of surprises.

Waiting for the card, holding it, and the thrill of its unpredictable arrival are experiences that digital messages can’t replicate. The paradox lies in its beautiful inefficiency, where the length of time it takes for the card to travel physically magnifies the emotional weight it carries.

Like many intelligent animals, kids possess an inherent desire to play, equipping them with the physical, emotional, and social toolkits crucial for life.\nIndependence Through Play\nAccording to Peter Gray, free play and exploration historically serve as avenues for children to grasp problem-solving, gain control over their lives, and cultivate personal interests. It’s as if nature designed this ‘curriculum’ to produce fully functional adults.\n1st Person Insight\nThis resonates with me because I feel like adults, including myself, have unlearned how to play. The idea of minimal adult control also speaks to the wider concept of autonomy, something I advocate for in my coaching practice. We need to trust the process of play, not just for kids but for adults, to rediscover skills and emotional resilience that are second nature during childhood but get buried under life’s complexities.\nAdult Supervision: A Constraint?\nInterestingly, children see play as something that transpires with minimal adult involvement. The presence of an adult turns the “play” into something else—perhaps a “task” or a “lesson.” The takeaway? True play happens in unstructured, minimally supervised spaces, allowing for organic growth and learning.\nWhy This Matters\nReintroducing play into our lives can be a bridge to wellness and improved mental health. If adults can step back and let children explore through play, maybe adults can give themselves the same freedom.

It reflects the pressure to continuously perform in a world that measures worth by productivity.

It’s not merely a form of expression but a dialogue with the ethics of our time. When I consider the role of art, I see it as central to our collective moral education. It’s an endeavor that holds a mirror to society, not just reflecting what is but potentially guiding to what could be.\nThis conviction holds that art and the humanities are not superfluous; they are instrumental in a life well-lived. They offer dimensions of understanding and compassion that are often invisible to the empirical eye. Some argue that the humanities didn’t provide tangible benefits to them, yet I believe they might not perceive the breadth of influence these disciplines have had on their ability to navigate life’s complexities.\nThrough the exploration of art, we embark on a journey towards a moral existence, striving for a communal life that thrives on flourishing and minimizes suffering. Art allows us to live life not just bearably but with a conscious attempt to do no harm—echoing the ancient Hippocratic Oath in a broader societal context.\nIn my journey, I’ve come to realize that to dismiss the humanities is to deny the compass of humanity’s moral and ethical navigation. Art, in all its forms, compels us to engage with the world, to recognize the intertwining of life’s beauty and brutality, and to ponder deeply on the human condition. It’s here, in the resonance of a painting, the depth of a novel, or the harmony of a musical composition, that the subtle art of living is often best understood.\nThe conversation surrounding art is often fraught with concerns of cultural elitism, yet at its core, the moral implications of art making beckon us towards an inclusive understanding of our shared human experience. It’s a testament to the power of the human spirit in pursuit of meaning and connection—attributes I see mirrored in the lives of those around me, from my clients to my family.\nThus, art is not just an aesthetic experience; it’s an ethical exercise, a practice in empathy, and a form of silent philosophy that prompts us to consider the ramifications of our existence alongside one another.

It’s the thread weaving through varied fabrics of human pursuit, from the quest for enlightenment to the practicalities of pain management.\nThe essence of mindfulness — sustained attention, present experience, and a non-judgmental stance — is echoed in practices like yoga, tai chi, and Feldenkrais. Here, the body becomes the mind’s canvas, with each posture and movement honed with deliberate, acute awareness.\nFor me, the real revelation lies in the simplicity of the manual task — the intimate dance of fingers and palms, shaping, fixing, creating. Engaging the hands in intricate activities isn’t just a hobby; it’s a cognitive tonic, nourishing the brain with every precise movement. This tactile intelligence reinforces the truth that our cerebral health is deeply intertwined with the dexterity of our hands.\nActivities such as walking, exercising, and gardening are not mere pastimes; they are practices of mindfulness. They nudge us gently into the present, encouraging a flow state where time recedes and focus sharpens. As a health coach, I see this as an untapped resource — an avenue where engaging the body helps command the mind, leading to enhanced well-being.\nThe tapestry of life is richer when threaded with mindful moments. Whether it’s through disciplined practices or the everyday act of working with one’s hands, mindfulness is not just a technique — it’s a way of living, breathing, and being fully immersed in the now.\n\nRead more at: Fetching Title#gqam\nYou may also be interested in: Move More on your hands"},"Notes/The-Mycelial-person-by-Tim-Ingold":{"title":"The Mycelial person by Tim Ingold","links":["Notes/The-world-is-too-similar-because-of-the-scale","Maps/Philosophy-MOC","Notes/Gut-microbes-and-brain-connections"],"tags":["-connection-","-mycelia-","-philosophy-"],"content":"Interestingly, according to the current theory of evolution, mushrooms represent a higher form of life than the animal kingdom, to which we belong.

Neuroscientific research, such as the work of Antonio Damasio, has shown that emotions are integral to the decision-making process. In fact, emotions can be thought of as a combination of sensation and context, deeply intertwined with our biological makeup.\nThe notion that emotions are “irrational” or “secondary” is a misconception. Emotions are not just fleeting feelings; they are complex biochemical events that influence our thoughts, behaviors, and decisions. Marcel Proust’s poetic description of love causing “geological upheavals of thought” may be evocative, but it’s the neuroscience that tells us emotions are fundamentally biological phenomena co-created by our minds.\nTrusting your gut isn’t a departure from rationality; it’s an embrace of a more holistic form of intelligence. In a world that often overvalues logical reasoning, recognizing the value of emotional intelligence can be a game-changer in both personal and professional decision-making.\n\nRead more at: The Best Decision-Making Is Emotional\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Data has killed our intuition"},"Notes/The-Myth-of-the-\"Perfect-Trip\"--Navigating-Travel-Guilt":{"title":"The Myth of the \"Perfect Trip\": Navigating Travel Guilt","links":["Notes/My-favorite-'hack'-when-I'm-hiking-and-traveling"],"tags":["travel","mindfulness","passive-income","life-balance"],"content":"Traveling, especially when funded by passive income, offers a luxury—time. However, the concept of “Travel Guilt” can often rob us of genuinely enjoying that luxury. This guilt, this nagging feeling that we should be doing ‘everything’ because we’ve invested in getting there, can be counterproductive.\nI’ve found that the best journeys aren’t about checking off a list of ‘must-dos’. It’s about being in the moment, allowing your intuition to guide your footsteps. Wander, explore, and engage with what genuinely catches your eye, not what a guidebook or social expectation demands.\nThe pressure to “maximize” a trip by visiting every site or tourist attraction stems from the same productivity mindset that we often try to escape when traveling. What’s the point of going to every room in the Louvre if you don’t genuinely appreciate each piece? Isn’t the aim of travel to enrich our lives, rather than to fill them with unchecked boxes?\nFor me, travel is a form of mindfulness. It’s a chance to step out of my daily routines and be completely present in a new context. And it’s not about just seeing the world but really experiencing it, absorbing it in its full texture and color. I would rather see fewer things but see them more deeply.\nSo, the next time you travel, permit yourself the freedom to explore, to miss out, and to truly experience what’s in front of you. This is not a race; it’s life. Your journey should be measured not by the number of photos or souvenirs but by the enrichment of your own life and perhaps even your soul.\n\nRead more at: Site Unreachable\nYou may also be interested in: My favorite ‘hack’ when I’m hiking and traveling"},"Notes/The-Ones-Who-Walk-Away-from-Omelas":{"title":"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas","links":["Literature-MOC"],"tags":["--"],"content":"\nRead more at: The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas - Wikipedia\nGo one level up : Literature MOC\nYou may also be interested in: CROSS"},"Notes/The-Pandemic’s-Legacy-Is-Already-Clear":{"title":"The Pandemic’s Legacy Is Already Clear","links":["Healthcare-MOC","Notes/Fitness-coaches-should-be-part-of-the-healthcare-system"],"tags":["pandemic","healthcare","policy","individualism"],"content":"The pandemic unveiled a stark truth: an ethos that equates physical and moral strength, that perceives social vulnerability as a result of personal weakness and not policy failures, falls short in the face of global crises.

While this approach is rational from a financial standpoint, it can sometimes overshadow the emotional and psychological gains of choosing an unconventional path. The excitement and potential of the new journey often make the financial stress worth enduring.\nThe concept of “leaning out,” as seen in alternative educational paths like homeschooling, can also apply to entrepreneurship. It’s about embracing an unconventional path that aligns with your philosophy, even if it comes with its own set of challenges and stresses.\nFinancial stress in entrepreneurship is a paradox. On one hand, it’s a constant reminder of the risks involved; on the other, it’s a testament to the courage it takes to follow an unconventional path. The key is to manage this stress not as a deterrent but as a complex variable in the equation of your life’s work.\nRemember, stress isn’t inherently bad; it’s about finding the right dose that challenges you but doesn’t break you.

Adults who choose to immigrate are making a conscious decision to change their circumstances, admitting they were in the “wrong” place and taking the steps to start anew. This is a form of self-selection that arguably brings together individuals with higher levels of initiative and adaptability.\nHowever, there’s a darker underbelly to this narrative. Viewing immigration through the lens of high agency can be seen as a form of neo-colonialism. It assumes that the “best and brightest” are those who leave their native lands, potentially draining those countries of valuable human capital. This perspective can perpetuate a cycle where the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer, both in terms of countries and individuals.\nFor those whose parents were the immigrants, they are often raised in an environment that continually reminds them of their “luck” or “privilege.” This can create a complex interplay of gratitude and pressure, which might influence their own sense of agency.\nAs someone deeply involved in the health and fitness sector, I can’t help but think about how this concept of agency applies to personal transformation. Just like immigrants, individuals seeking to change their health status must admit they’re in the “wrong” place and take steps to improve. But let’s not forget, the journey is fraught with systemic challenges that can’t be overcome by agency alone.\nUnderstanding this nuanced view of agency can help us better navigate the complexities of human behavior, whether it’s in the context of immigration or personal growth.\n\nRead more at: diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1211877/FULLTEXT01.pdf\nGo one level up : Social Sciences MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Fertility and Society"},"Notes/The-Paradox-of-Progress--Population-Decline-and-Future-Societies":{"title":"The Paradox of Progress: Population Decline and Future Societies","links":["Notes/Global-Demographics-Video"],"tags":["demographic-shift","demographics","futurism","population-dynamics","population","social-change"],"content":"As a phenomenon that’s both global and local, the demographic dip into depopulation is a tide turning quietly yet pervasively. UN data echoes the foresight of demographers who, decades earlier, projected a shift from burgeoning populations to contractions, especially in affluent, technologically advanced nations. The streets of Manila may buzz with youth and vibrancy, obscuring the bigger picture that globally, even in corners of the Philippines, a demographic quietude looms.\nIn less than a generation, the picture UN data paints suggest that shrinking populations won’t be anomalies but part of the world’s standard sociodemographic fabric, akin to the once extraordinary now mundane – high literacy rates or the ubiquity of obesity. What strikes me is the silent encroachment of this change; in the Philippines, where the thrum of life seems ceaseless, the notion of depopulation feels almost heretical.\nThis demographic decline is not a distant future’s tale but a present narrative unfolding, shaping how societies operate, economies burgeon or buckle, and cultures adapt or resist. It’s a heresy against the old doctrine of perpetual growth, a fundamental rethinking of what progress means when fewer voices will echo in tomorrow’s halls.

In the healthcare setting, we often encounter two archetypes: the “good” patient who maintains a facade of normalcy and health, and the “bad” patient who is unapologetically vocal about their ailments. The good patients often serve as the decorous face of healthcare, while the bad patients, by lashing out and being “annoying,” reveal the uncomfortable truths that lie beneath the surface.\nFrom my vantage point as a health coach, I see a similar dynamic. Doctors, trained to be experts in their field, sometimes lack the emotional intelligence to connect with their patients on a human level. This can be frustrating for patients who seek not just medical advice but also emotional support. On the flip side, some patients come in as “know-it-alls,” armed with Google searches and a distrust of the medical establishment, making it difficult for any meaningful exchange to occur.\nThis dynamic reminds me of the concept of hormesis in exercise and stress management. Just as a certain amount of stress can be beneficial, perhaps what’s needed in the patient-doctor relationship is a balanced approach that incorporates both emotional intelligence and medical expertise.\nThe irony is that both the “good” and the “bad” patients need each other. The good patients set the tone of decorum and control, while the bad patients serve as the canaries in the coal mine, signaling when something is amiss in the healthcare system. It’s a symbiotic relationship, albeit a tense one.\nThe key takeaway is that both doctors and patients have room for improvement. Doctors could benefit from honing their emotional intelligence skills, while patients could work on building trust and understanding the limitations of medical science. Ultimately, the goal is a healthcare system that values both medical expertise and human connection, without one overshadowing the other.\n\nRead more at: Issue No. 242: The Replacements | Fitt Insider\nGo one level up : Healthcare MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Fitness coaches should be part of the healthcare system"},"Notes/The-Paradox-of-the-Agricultural-Market":{"title":"The Paradox of the Agricultural Market","links":["Notes/The-Problem-of-Middlemen"],"tags":["agriculture","economics","market-dynamics","crop-yield","price"],"content":"Navigating the Complex Currents of Crop Commerce\nIn the vast and often unpredictable sea of agriculture, the winds of market forces blow unevenly. The farmer, sower of seeds and tender of the earth, stands at the mercy of a paradoxical market. Here, in the realm of grains, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, one’s toil is quantified in yields, and success is measured by the alchemy of multiplication — yield times price.\nYet, this multiplication bears an asterisk, a footnote that speaks volumes: farmers frequently face the reality of being price takers, not makers. It’s a stark reminder that even as they harness the rhythms of nature to produce bountiful harvests, their voice in the chorus of commerce is but a whisper.\nFrom my standpoint, it’s a glaring caveat in the narrative of the free market. I often ponder the contrast between the ideal of a market guided by invisible hands and the reality where those who coax life from the soil lack leverage in their trade. In competitive commodity markets, the rules of supply and demand dictate the tempo, yet producers find their influence diluted.\nThis realization isn’t just academic — it’s a call to appreciate the undercurrents shaping the livelihood of the stewards of our food supply. As I consider the bigger picture, it’s clear that innovation in agricultural practices and policy interventions may be necessary to create a more equitable arena where farmers can thrive not only by the generosity of nature but also within a market structure that recognizes and rewards their labor more fairly.\n\nRead more at: Crops grow where cash flows - by Ariel Patton - Topsoil\nYou may also be interested in: The Problem of Middlemen"},"Notes/The-Perpetual-Cycle-of-Motivation":{"title":"The Perpetual Cycle of Motivation","links":["Notes/Hacking-Your-Environment-to-Master-Motivation"],"tags":["motivation","creation","resilience","fitness","dedication"],"content":"Grasping motivation in fitness is not a one-off victory; it’s a continuous process of creation and recreation, a cycle that demands constant nurturing.

Even the most dedicated athletes and trainers must sometimes muster the willpower to create and recreate the impulse to move, day after day.\nIn my own journey as a health coach and an advocate for fitness, I confront this reality daily. Motivation isn’t just stumbled upon; it’s crafted, deconstructed, and rebuilt, often from the ground up. It’s about acknowledging that motivation is not a static entity but a dynamic process that requires patience and perseverance. The act of rolling out the mat or lacing up sneakers is not a testament to effortless drive but to the conscious decision to engage in the labor of creating and recreating the zest to move.\nRecognizing this shared challenge offers comfort and a point of connection for all of us on this path.

If we roll this narrative back a couple of decades, perhaps even just a generation, we’d see an entirely different story. It’s as if we’re steadily erasing the colorful lines that define our innate creativity. But why? In our quest for productivity and structured lives, we’ve sidelined the one thing that fed the flames of our imagination: play.\nThe statistic from “The Creativity Crisis” is both an indictment and a wake-up call. Here’s a puzzling paradox: we live in an era of unprecedented technological advances designed to make our lives easier and more fun, and yet the levels of natural expressiveness and creativity among children are in decline. Let’s not kid ourselves; it’s not just the children who are affected. The adults, too, are victims of this paradigm shift, trading imaginative breaks for structured conference calls and PowerPoint presentations.\nHere’s a groundbreaking perspective: “You can’t teach creativity; all you can do is let it blossom, and it blossoms in play.” I resonate with this deeply. Play isn’t something to fit in after we’ve finished all our ‘important’ tasks; it IS the important task. Just as a muscle withers without exercise, so does creativity shrivel without play. In the name of efficiency, have we forgotten the essence of being effective? If we’re too rigid to see beyond the script, how are we ever going to improvise, adapt, and ultimately, thrive?\nThis notion circles back to some of my earlier notes on hormesis and the concept of “good stress.” Could the decline in play and creativity be a form of societal hormesis gone wrong? By stripping away the play from our lives, we’ve inoculated ourselves against the unpredictable, challenging, yet ultimately enriching circumstances that hone our creativity and resilience.\nWe’re not merely organisms striving to reach a KPI; we’re creative beings yearning to live, express, and connect. The absence of play isn’t just an absence of fun; it’s the suppression of our human spirit.\nSo what’s the game plan?

It’s what I call the “Top-Left Box Syndrome.” Here, you’re presented with an avalanche of success stories that don’t just celebrate achievements but also tend to monopolize the narrative. It’s a carefully curated illusion, one that can warp our perspective and set unrealistic expectations.\nThe Possibility Grid urges us to examine what’s often left unspoken—the failures, the unsuccessful attempts, and the null results. In the world of health coaching and entrepreneurship, this can be invaluable. For example, when someone promises that their workout regime or nutrition supplement will change your life, remember to ask: “What are the rates of success, and how do these compare to doing nothing?” It’s a simple question but one that can puncture a lot of inflated promises.\nThis isn’t just for skeptics or naysayers.

However, in the landscape of behavioral change, it becomes a powerful tool for accountability.\nIt’s tempting to mock or belittle these displays—perhaps a defensive mechanism to shield us from facing our own fears or inadequacies. Indeed, a reluctance to be ‘on the hook’ often emanates from an underlying fear of judgment or failure. This is no different from an actor suffering stage fright; the audience brings a weight of expectation that can either crush you or galvanize your performance.\nYet, the irony is palpable. The very act of public commitment that invites ridicule also demands respect. Like an entrepreneur staking their own capital in a venture, the risk itself commands a certain level of seriousness. It forces a reconfiguration of priorities and actions in alignment with the declared objective, essentially transforming the “virtual” into “actual.”\nImagine for a moment that each post is like a piece in a mosaic.

Allowing someone to be the genius they were meant to be.\nThat reminds me Unlearning how we were taught to behave\nIt’s similar because there are so many things from our education that we need to let go of and unlearn. For health it could be what does it mean to be healthy. what does it mean to be a happy person?\nIt’s different because There probably are sometimes when you need structure, and less agency. There must be times when you have to be told what to do.

Feelings of fear, shame, or uncertainty often derail us from our goals. I’ve been co-working with JieYu for over a year, and the results are testament to the efficacy of using “body doubling” as a technique to regulate these emotions.\nTransforming Solitude into Social Experience\nWhen we engage in solitary work, the presence of a body double turns it into a social experience, making tasks less daunting. The phenomenon of social buffering kicks in, and suddenly, we find that we’re responding differently to potential distractions or challenges. This makes what used to be avoidable tasks suddenly more doable.\nAdapt and Apply\nDifferent tasks might necessitate different kinds of body doubles or even different modes of interaction with them. The technique is not a one-size-fits-all solution. You must identify your target activity and thoughtfully choose a co-working partner, considering the amount of effort and involvement required from both parties.\nWhy This Matters\nMy personal experience has proven that body doubling is not just another productivity hack; it’s a powerful strategy for consistent performance. Especially in areas prone to procrastination and emotional resistance. It’s a game-changer in the way we approach work, turning solitary tasks into social, engaging activities.\nRemember\nBody doubling is more than a simple productivity tool; it’s a method to understand and navigate the emotional complexities that often impede our performance. It transforms the nature of work and mitigates the inherent challenges of certain tasks.\n\nRead more at: Hack Your Focus With Body Doubling\nYou may also be interested in: Accountability is the key to good habits"},"Notes/The-Power-of-Illeism--A-Linguistic-Hack-for-Wiser-Reasoning":{"title":"The Power of Illeism: A Linguistic Hack for Wiser Reasoning","links":["Maps/Psychology-MOC","Notes/Using-Fitness-to-Build-up-Your-confidence"],"tags":["cognitive-bias","cognitive-tricks","self-awareness","decision-making","emotional-intelligence"],"content":"Illeism, the practice of referring to oneself in the third person, is more than a rhetorical flourish used by politicians and historical figures. It’s a cognitive tool that can help us gain a more objective perspective on our own problems. Think of it as a mental “zoom out” button, allowing us to see the forest for the trees.\nStudies suggest that employing illeism can lead to greater intellectual humility, an increased capacity to recognize others’ perspectives, and a willingness to compromise. These are all markers of wise reasoning. For someone like me, who often finds himself wrestling with challenges and seeking support, this is a game-changer.\nThe beauty of illeism lies in its simplicity. A small linguistic switch can lead to a profound shift in mindset. It’s akin to changing the camera angle in a film to reveal elements that were previously hidden.\nIn a world where we’re often too caught up in our own narratives, illeism offers a way to step back and view our lives as if we were impartial observers.

It’s a landscape where FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) can run rampant, often driven by the clamor of proselytizing communities.\nHowever, a counterintuitive truth emerges from the chaos: The more a community exudes FOMO, the less reliable its advice may be. The best investment decisions often occur before a particular asset becomes the focal point of an identity or a cult-like following. Conversely, when a community reaches the point of religious fervor around an idea, it can be a signal to consider exit strategies.\nYet, the human tendency is often to misinterpret manic insecurity as validation and to follow the herd at the peak of risk. It’s a pattern seen not only in investments but also in personal pursuits.\nIn the journey of health coaching and entrepreneurship, moments of self-doubt are inevitable. However, the key to success lies in mastering one’s own fear and insecurity. Trusting in your expertise and the value you bring to the table can guide you through moments of uncertainty. Even when doubts creep in, the steadfast belief in your abilities and the genuine worth of your offerings can be a beacon of confidence.\nRemember, confidence need not be loud; it often whispers.

For me, it’s clear: diversity is a multi-faceted concept that, when improperly managed, can indeed lead to inefficiencies.\nAs proposed, to disentangle the noble objective of uplifting woman-owned businesses from the intricate and technologically demanding task of semiconductor fabrication could be the strategic clarity needed in industrial policy.\nThe notion holds water—the goals of diversity and industry excellence need not be conjoined at the hip, and could be pursued independently for better outcomes.\nFrom my experience, when dealing with an operation as delicate as fab construction, a seamless and streamlined process trumps the diversity quota. However, this does not negate the pursuit of diversity. Rather, it calls for a more nuanced approach, where diversity initiatives are designed to complement, not compromise, operational effectiveness.\nA Thoughtful Unbundling\nIf we accept Ezra’s perspective, the deliberate unbundling of objectives presents a clearer path to achieving both without the friction of one impeding the other. It’s about being pragmatic—strategically fostering diversity in areas where it naturally fits, while maintaining a laser focus on efficiency where it’s most critical.\nUltimately, this nuanced approach to industrial policy—where we harness the strengths of a diverse workforce without losing sight of core operational goals—may pave the way for a more productive and inclusive industry.\n\nRead more at: Industrial policy doesn’t have to succeed right away\nYou may also be interested in: Sleep we lost preindustrial slumber"},"Notes/The-Precious-Window-of-Parental-Love":{"title":"The Precious Window of Parental Love","links":["Maps/Parenting-MOC","Notes/How-we-unconsciously-parent"],"tags":["parenting","family","moments","growing"],"content":"In the journey of parenthood, there exists a magical window, a fleeting period of 8 to 12 years when you and your child become each other’s absolute favorite people in the world.

If she’s a good doctor, she’ll prescribe an amount that’s enough to get the job done.\nWhen I saw a doctor for my nerve pain, she prescribed me 2 tablets a day of a pill that helped me with it. But she also said,* “see how you respond, and if it improves, we may be able to reduce the dosage to 1 tablet.”* Now I understand that she was trying to find the minimum effective dose for me.\nIn practice, the minimum effective dose is different from person to person. So a good doctor knows more or less what works, but also how to tweak it for each patient.\nFarnam Street Minimum Effective Dose\nThis idea is worth exploring when it comes to fitness.\nAs I’m trying to experiment on some fitness principles (link to previous post), I think this is something that applies not just to medicines but to exercises also.\nOnce upon a time, I would spend hours in the gym and on the track. (I used to be a college athlete.) And when you’re trying to be the best in your sport, go ahead and train your brains out.\nToday, there are a lot of other things I’d like to do. I’d rather spend time woodworking or gardening.

This could make it a useful tool for urban planners and transportation engineers to consider when designing and building new transportation infrastructure in cities and towns.\nIn the Philippines, it is possible that there are many examples of this type of infrastructure, as the country is known for its high population density and fast-paced urban development. However, it would be important for local authorities to ensure that the design and construction of strodes takes into account the safety of all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. Additionally, it would be important to consider the environmental impact of strodes, such as their potential to contribute to air and noise pollution, and to mitigate these impacts wherever possible.\nThat’s interesting because\nThat reminds me\nIt’s similar because\nIt’s different because\nIt’s important because"},"Notes/The-Problem-with-Using-Metaphors-for-Mental-Health-and-Illness":{"title":"The Problem with Using Metaphors for Mental Health and Illness","links":["Notes/Visible-tracking-illness-and-not-health"],"tags":["metaphors","mental-health","illness-stigma","complexity"],"content":"Metaphors are often used to help us grasp complex concepts, like the inner workings of the mind or the intricacies of illness. We liken the mind to a “machine,” or sometimes even a “computer,” to make sense of its functions and malfunctions. But herein lies the issue: our minds are not mechanistic entities that can be “repaired” by a technician. By employing these metaphors, we risk oversimplifying the complexities involved, thereby failing to address them adequately.\nSusan Sontag’s work, “Illness as Metaphor,” pushes us to question our metaphorical framing of illnesses. Metaphors shape not only our understanding but also our treatment and perception of those affected. Think of the moral undertones that come with terms like “fighting” an illness. It implies that if you’re not “winning,” you’re not fighting hard enough. A damaging perspective, especially when applied to mental health.\nWhile metaphors might aid in exploring convoluted subjects like science, politics, and even AI, they can be severely limiting in others. I can’t help but think about how metaphors contribute to the moralization of illnesses. If someone is “broken,” are they less valuable? Are they to be discarded or fixed? These are ethical questions that metaphors, unintentionally or not, bring into the conversation.\nIt’s essential to remember that metaphors are not universally applicable. They can be especially perilous in the realm of health and illness, where misunderstanding can have dire consequences. I think it’s high time we consider revising our metaphorical language to better reflect the complexity and nuance of human health. Otherwise, we inadvertently contribute to the stigmatization and misunderstanding of these conditions, something that can only impede progress.\nLet’s be critical of the language we use, understanding that it shapes our reality and can either hinder or facilitate empathy and progress.\n\nRead more at: Episode #178 - Transcript — Philosophize This!\nYou may also be interested in: Visible tracking illness and not health"},"Notes/The-Problem-with-moralizing-health":{"title":"The Problem with moralizing health","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202201070930- The Problem with moralizing health\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note\nurl: §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nI mentioned this book in passing before, and I was able to finish reading over the holidays.\nThe author, Barbara Ehrenreich, is a political scientist who takes her critical eye to the health and wellness industry.\nWhile I don’t agree with everything she writes, there are a few quotes from the book that really hit home.

We’re now seeing this materialize in various domains, challenging the perennial urge to optimize every facet of our lives. But what about fitness? Is there room for a “Slow Fitness” movement that deviates from the culture of more reps, faster runs, and quick fixes?\nAs someone deeply invested in helping others lead a healthier lifestyle, and personally grappling with the monotony of exercise, I find the concept of Slow Fitness compelling. Just like in Slow Living, the goal isn’t merely to ‘slow down’ but to bring mindfulness into the activity. Imagine savoring each movement, appreciating the stretch of each muscle, and genuinely tuning into the experience. Isn’t the essence of fitness not just to elevate our physical but also our mental well-being?\nI believe the value of Slow Fitness is more than just an ideological stance. It’s an invitation to integrate a richer sense of balance and purpose into our daily routines. In a world where we’re always looking for the next big thing in health and fitness, perhaps what we really need is to look inward. I’ve always said that lasting change starts from within, and Slow Fitness embodies this perfectly. It could be the missing piece for those struggling with the tediousness of regular workouts.\nSo the next time you tie your shoelaces for a jog or roll out your yoga mat, ask yourself: what’s the rush?

Yet emerging research is adding a new player to the game—omega-3 fatty acids. These studies are showing promising signs that high-dose omega-3s can help counteract the natural resistance our bodies develop against the muscle-building effects of protein and physical activity as we age.\nLiving in the Philippines, where fish is abundant, accessing omega-3s isn’t much of a challenge. But the potential here is not just convenience; it’s about unlocking new pathways for maintaining muscle mass and strength well into later years. While it’s still early days in this research, the implications for both individual health and public policy are profound.\nGiven that most strategies against age-related muscle loss focus predominantly on protein and exercise, it’s refreshing to see nutrition playing a broader role. It’s almost like the “magic pill” we’ve been searching for isn’t really a pill at all, but something as simple yet effective as omega-3 fatty acids.\nWhat this means for anyone interested in long-term health and vitality is clear: don’t underestimate the power of your diet.

Often, this involves prompting them to discuss their end-of-life dreams and share them with their loved ones.\nThis practice serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it allows the patient to explore the dreams and visions that often signify the nearing end, providing an avenue for them to make sense of it all. Secondly, sharing these experiences with family creates a dialogue that can be both cathartic and enlightening for everyone involved.\nI resonate strongly with this approach. Spirituality isn’t just a nebulous concept; it has practical implications for our wellbeing that go beyond the physical. This methodology exemplifies the notion that emotional and spiritual health can have a tangible impact on how we navigate the end-of-life process.\nThe emphasis on creating a sacred space highlights the multi-dimensional nature of healthcare. While medical treatment focuses on the physical, this practice acknowledges the emotional and spiritual dimensions that are equally crucial but often overlooked.\nIn light of this, we should consider the impact of spiritual care not only at the end of life but throughout the healthcare continuum.

Familiarity at the start lowers the activation energy required to begin, and an engaging end leaves a lasting impression.\nI have to say, this is a useful tip that could be a game-changer in how I design my fitness programs. It’s about more than just the exercises; it’s about shaping the client’s experience from start to finish.\nThe ‘Sandwich Effect’ is a nifty way to leverage behavioral psychology to improve adherence and increase client retention.

This concept takes on a complex flavor when stirred into the capitalist pot, where the essence of competition and individuality often boil to the surface.\nIn the pursuit of building a community, we must consider civility not merely as a superficial layer of polite engagement but as a profound strategy for managing the multifaceted nature of human difference. Civility under capitalism, then, is a balancing act, a deliberate dance between maintaining individual freedoms and fostering a sense of shared moral responsibility.\nContrary to the staunch defenders of ‘light civility’, who advocate for minimalistic social interactions underpinned by mere toleration, I argue for a civility that requires us to dig deeper—beyond the veneer of courteous exchanges. This is a civility that cannot thrive on the uneven grounds of extreme social inequality; it necessitates a certain levelling of the playing field, where voices from diverse socio-economic strata can resonate with equal vigor.\nThe backbone of a thriving community, as I’ve come to understand, isn’t constructed from the rigid steel of imposed rules, but is rather woven from the supple strands of shared moral understandings. As I reflect on this, I am reminded that the true spirit of civility must be nurtured—it’s a collective cultivation of respect, patience, and a willingness to listen, even when the cacophony of disparate views seems overwhelming.\nThis strategic civility is not a byproduct of the congested urban existence, nor is it an automatic response to the challenges of diversity. It is, instead, a cultivated garden in the concrete jungle of capitalist enterprise, demanding active tending from each of us. As someone invested in the fabric of community, I see this as a call to action—to plant the seeds of equity and grow a culture where the fruits of civility can truly flourish.\n\nRead more at: On civility - Engelsberg ideas\nYou may also be interested in: Building Trust Online"},"Notes/The-Semmelweis-Reflex-(concept)":{"title":"The Semmelweis Reflex (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Semmelweis Reflex (concept) §\nSource §\n\nI think it was Cautionary Tales\n\nKey Idea §\nStory §\n\nIgnaz Semmelweiss was a Hungarian physician\nHe discovered in 1847 that hospital mortality fell when doctors disinfected their hands with a chlorine solution\nHis ideas were rejected  because of non-scientific resistance and things that had to do more with ego\n“gentleman’s hands cannot transmit disease”\n"},"Notes/The-Serendipity-of-Asking":{"title":"The Serendipity of Asking","links":["Notes/Embracing-the-Art-of-\"Showing-Up\"-in-the-World-of-Entrepreneurship"],"tags":["persistence","mentorship","asking","entrepreneurship","inspiration"],"content":"In the entrepreneurial journey, persistence isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a lifeline.

His actions remind me that the ecosystem of success is often nurtured by the wisdom of others.\nCharles’s endeavor to finance his podcast through loans is a testament to his commitment, a reflection of the all-in attitude required to carve out a space in any field. It’s this kind of bold move, coupled with the humility to ask for help, that often leads to unexpected alliances and growth.\nAs I reflect on his hopes for the podcast to aid other black men, I’m reminded of my own aspirations to foster a community where knowledge and support flow freely. Every request for assistance, every attempt to connect is a step towards a greater goal, not just for oneself, but for the collective good.\nSo, I take from Charles’s narrative a personal call to action: to continue reaching out, to persist against the odds, and to embrace every serendipitous connection that comes my way.\n\nRead more at: Started From The Bottom with Justin Richmond | Revisionist History\nYou may also be interested in: Embracing the Art of “Showing Up” in the World of Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/The-Smart-Economics-of-Eating-Healthy":{"title":"The Smart Economics of Eating Healthy","links":["Food-MOC","Notes/Making-your-own-food-is-a-gamechanger"],"tags":["nutrition","personal-finance","behavioral-economics","decision-making"],"content":"As someone with a deep respect for local farmers markets and their inherent quality, it’s been a bit of a revelation to reconsider the value proposition of Costco—or any large-scale grocery operation—in the realm of nutrition. The lens of personal finance offers an interesting perspective on eating healthy. If someone like my uncle, a wizard in personal finance, can meticulously calculate the cost-benefit ratio of fruits and vegetables down to the per-pound price, there’s more to this story than “cheaper is worse.”\nLarge-scale stores like Costco wield the power of economies of scale to offer nutritional choices at a fraction of the cost without skimping on quality. It’s akin to the principle of hormesis in training; balance is key. While supporting local markets keeps us rooted in our communities, there’s a place for the efficiency of bulk-buying in our lives, especially when it comes to staples. My initial bias towards local markets might have been holding me back from a more optimized, yet still ethical, choice in sourcing my food.\nLet’s pull a page out of the book of “diversified investments.” Why not mix it up and take the best of both worlds? For instance, head to local farmers markets for specialized items and fresh produce but turn to Costco for staple items that have a longer shelf life. Not unlike a well-curated workout, a balanced approach to sourcing food can yield optimal results without breaking the bank.\nMoreover, why stop at a personal level? Imagine integrating this hybrid strategy into health coaching. By giving clients a diversified ‘shopping portfolio,’ we are facilitating not just their health but also contributing to their financial wellness.\nSo yes, as much as I value the experience of a morning spent at a local farmers market, there’s room in my philosophy for the spreadsheet-driven, cost-effective nutritional wisdom that large scale operations can offer.

BUT you must balance that with realism, and confront your current reality.\nIt comes from the experience of Admiral James Stockdale who ended up in a Vietnamese POW camp during the war. He would only be rescued 5 years later!\nStockdale described his approach in an interview with Jim Collins, explaining,\n\n“I never lost faith in the end of the story. I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life, which, in retrospect, I would not trade.”\n\n\n“This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose—with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.”\n\nThe Problem with Optimism §\nWho succumbed first when it came to surviving these challenging experiences?\nThe optimists\nStockdale Again:\n\n“They were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by Christmas.’ And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. Then they’d say, ‘We’re going to be out by Easter.’ And Easter would come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart.”\n\nCompare this to Viktor Frankl’s experience in the concentration camps.\nFrankl also related a similar idea to Stockdale, talking about the power of “tragic optimism, that is, an optimism in the face of tragedy.”\nStockdale didn’t credit the pessimists with much better success than the optimists, saying that they gave in soon afterwards.\nInstead he suggests finding that almost paradoxical balance between acceptance of the brutal reality of now, with unwavering faith in how you will make it in the end.\nI also just wrote about being blindly optimistic here about health, and why that isn’t the approach I would ultimately like to take\nRead it here: Working on Your Health is Really Hard- And That’s Okay! - Coach Javiie\n\nRead more at: ModelThinkers - Stockdale Paradox\nGo one level up : Health Mindsets MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Paradoxes of Health"},"Notes/The-Story-of-Sans-Forgetica-and-Desirable-Difficulty":{"title":"The Story of Sans Forgetica and Desirable Difficulty","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Story of Sans Forgetica and Desirable Difficulty §\nSource: §\n\nhttps://sansforgetica.rmit.edu.au/\n\nKey Idea §\n\nIt’s a font that’s designed to engage your brian more\n"},"Notes/The-Strangely-Beautiful-Experience-of-Google-Reviews--The-Absurdity-of-Rating-Everything":{"title":"The Strangely Beautiful Experience of Google Reviews: The Absurdity of Rating Everything","links":["Notes/Looking-at-amazon-reviews-for-health-journals"],"tags":["reviews","absudity","binary-thinking","social-behavior"],"content":"The five-star rating system has inadvertently created a binary approach to reviewing experiences, products, or services. Most reviews are either glowing or scathing, leaving little room for nuanced perspectives. This system oversimplifies experiences that are often complex and multi-faceted.\nIn the podcast “Anthropocene Reviewed,” they point out the absurdity of this. The podcast itself is a critique of our need to review everything around us. Why does everything need a rating? I’ve observed that the compulsion to categorize and label often robs us of the richness of the experience itself.\nSo, what’s the alternative? One might argue for more nuanced systems or even for the radical idea of not reviewing at all. After all, not every experience can be distilled into a star rating. Think about it: Does a stunning sunset or an emotionally charged conversation with a loved one deserve a rating? Some things are just beyond stars.\nYet, despite its flaws, the five-star system isn’t entirely useless. It’s a quick gauge, an instant way for us to share and seek validation for our experiences. But we should remember, it’s a limited tool and not a substitute for real, textured human experiences.\nFor me, the intriguing part is the societal behavior this encourages. When almost everything is rated, what are the implications on our collective psyche? Do we become more critical or judgmental? Or perhaps it fosters a more competitive landscape where only the ‘best’ experiences or services are sought after, leaving behind a graveyard of three-star worlds that might be equally enriching.\nThe Anthropocene Reviewed : NPR\n\nRead more at: The Strangely Beautiful Experience of Google Reviews - Longreads\nYou may also be interested in: Looking at amazon reviews for health journals"},"Notes/The-Subtle-Rebellion-of-'Revenge-Bedtime-Procrastination'":{"title":"The Subtle Rebellion of 'Revenge Bedtime Procrastination'","links":["Notes/Capitalism-and-it-destroys-the-health-of-workers"],"tags":["entrepreneurship","work-life-balance","mental-health","social-media"],"content":"As an entrepreneur, I know the pressures of a high-demand lifestyle. But imagine this issue under the lens of wage slavery—where every second is dictated by the employer’s whims. This is where “revenge bedtime procrastination” finds its roots. This term refers to the act of delaying sleep in favor of scrolling through social media or engaging in other non-fulfilling activities. It’s a cry for autonomy, a rebellion against a system that has us clocked in around the clock.\nThe idea of procrastination as a form of quiet rebellion is particularly compelling. According to the essay, there’s even a hint that this could evolve into a social movement. What’s eye-opening here is the proposal that this form of procrastination isn’t just wasting time but potentially a building block for larger societal change.\nIt’s intriguing to consider how seemingly trivial actions might just be the starting point for a broader movement. But it also serves as a wakeup call for entrepreneurs like me. When business challenges weigh me down, I remember this could be the reality for most—stuck in a never-ending cycle where even rest is a luxury.\nWe should not only listen to these subtle signs of unrest but also work towards creating environments—be it in corporations or startups—where people don’t feel the need to rebel in such a quiet, almost sad, way.

Forget about active minutes, calories burned, or average heart rate; it’s the number of steps taken that wins the race. This is a compelling finding because it simplifies a complex issue into a single data point that is easy to track.\nOne might assume that a more “sophisticated” metric like heart rate or calorie expenditure would offer a better gauge of emotional well-being. The study debunks this, asserting that steps are the most predictive factor. This doesn’t mean that every step is a step away from anxiety or depression; rather, it suggests that people who are active in a very basic way may be better positioned against mental health challenges.\nThe idea connects intriguingly with hormesis, the principle that low-level stressors (like walking) can build resilience. It’s almost like the body says, “If I can walk this much, then I must be doing okay.”\nIt makes me wonder: Could the simple act of walking more be an underestimated tool in mental health management? As someone deeply invested in making exercise less boring and more approachable, this finding offers an exciting area for further investigation.\nThis brings me back to the essence of the Camino walk in Spain, which became a transformative experience for me. Walking, it seems, is not just an exercise for the legs but also for the soul. We often overlook this ancient, simple form of movement for fancier workouts and metrics. Yet, the soul doesn’t require complexity to heal or to be in equilibrium; it often just needs consistent, simple actions. This note is a poignant reminder of that.\nIf you’re stuck in a cycle of introspection regarding your mental health and you’re unsure how to break through, this finding might give you the nudge to just start walking more. Sometimes, the simplest actions can yield the most profound results.

According to EEG studies, even a brief 15-minute walk in a natural setting outperforms the same walk indoors when it comes to cognitive enhancement. In essence, nature isn’t just a backdrop for physical activity—it’s a co-conspirator in boosting mental well-being.\nFor someone who genuinely enjoys being outdoors, this insight resonates deeply. I’ve always felt that nature adds a layer of richness to the exercise experience that can’t be replicated in a gym setting. It’s not just the fresh air or the scenic views; it’s the unpredictable terrain, the rustle of leaves, and the feeling of being a part of something much bigger than oneself.\nThis reaffirms why my favorite place to move and get active is outdoors. For people seeking an effective exercise regimen, understanding this symbiosis between nature and physical activity can be a game-changer. It serves as a reminder to not only be active but to be mindful of our settings when doing so.\nFor those of us who already love the outdoors, this is less a revelation and more a scientific validation of what we’ve known in our bones all along. It also serves as a clarion call for those who haven’t yet discovered the unique benefits of outdoor exercise. So, the next time you tie up your sneakers, consider stepping outside your door rather than onto a treadmill.

Just like culinary trends or fashion crazes, they sweep in with the promise of revolutionizing the way we approach exercise. Nordic walking is no exception. Despite the initial eye-rolls or scoffs, let’s give it some credit. It opens doors for people to explore the benefits of full-body workouts while enjoying the great outdoors. And let’s face it, anything that can convince people to get out and move is worthy of applause.\nHowever, the key here is not to pigeonhole ourselves into believing that the latest trend is the end-all-be-all of fitness. Think of it as a guest DJ at a party; they bring in a new energy, everyone’s vibing to it, but eventually, the set ends, and it’s onto the next one. But for that moment, everyone’s having a great time. Fitness fads offer a similar burst of enthusiasm. They rekindle your inspiration and breathe new life into a possibly stale routine.\nI’m no stranger to this concept. In my experience as a health coach, I find that these fads can be incredibly motivating, at least temporarily. So why not ride the wave? Nordic walking, for instance, isn’t just about keeping your body in motion; it’s also a communal experience, especially if you join one of the many clubs sprouting around the country. The collective energy of a group can be infectious, reinvigorating your commitment to physical activity.\nAs Madden points out, the added perk of exercising outdoors, backed by its proven benefits on mental health, makes Nordic walking all the more compelling. The environment in which you move your body can sometimes be as impactful as the movement itself. A change of scenery, coupled with a change in activity, could very well be the spark you need to reignite your passion for fitness.\nAt the end of the day, fads aren’t built to last, but their ephemeral nature doesn’t detract from their value. They serve as catalysts, sometimes providing the nudge we need to step out of our comfort zones. So next time a new fitness fad makes waves, don’t be too quick to dismiss it.

Instead of viewing time as an elusive and ever-fleeting resource, consider this: “How does doing what I need make time for everything else?”\nThis concept might seem counterintuitive at first glance, but when applied to exercise, it unveils a profound truth. For individuals like Javier, who value their health and well-being, exercise isn’t about carving out precious minutes from an already busy schedule. Rather, it’s a time investment that yields substantial returns.\nBy engaging in regular physical activity, such as hiking and maintaining a fitness regimen, Javier experiences time benefits that extend beyond the gym. The act of exercising not only contributes to his overall health but also enhances his productivity. When he dedicates time to exercise, he’s essentially “creating” time by boosting his energy levels, mental clarity, and focus.\nThis newfound vitality spills over into his work and daily activities, making him more efficient and effective. It’s as though exercise acts as a catalyst, amplifying the time he has available for other pursuits.

But there’s an untapped richness in diverging from the well-trodden path: the profound act of self-discovery. This insight isn’t just academic; it’s my lived experience.\nWhen we walk the unbeaten path, we’re not just rebelling against the system; we’re engaging in a dynamic process of figuring out what genuinely matters to us. This goes beyond company mission statements or job descriptions. It seeps into our core, prompting us to define our values independently, rather than having them spoon-fed by external authorities.\nIn a society hyper-focused on winning, we rarely stop to ask: Is the game even worth playing? For those like me who have taken the road less traveled, the answer often reveals itself organically. We’ve done the hard work of determining our values, our criteria for what a “win” really is, and in doing so, we might just find that we’ve won a game far more satisfying than any traditional path could offer.\nThis resonates with what I’ve learned about The Importance of Knowing What Drives You. The opportunity to determine what you genuinely care about is not just a bonus; it’s essential. In a world where the markers of success are predefined, having the courage to create your own metrics is both empowering and necessary.\n\nRead more at: In Praise of the Meandering Career\nYou may also be interested in: How Multipassionate People Build Careers"},"Notes/The-Underestimated-Skill-of-Interoception--Mastering-Your-Inner-Universe":{"title":"The Underestimated Skill of Interoception- Mastering Your Inner Universe","links":["Maps/Body-MOC","Notes/How-to-develop-expert-level-Jedi-powers"],"tags":["mental-health","body-awareness","self-regulation","technology","paradox"],"content":"Interoception, the so-called “sixth sense,” provides a fascinating lens through which to observe the symbiotic relationship between mental and physical health. At its core, interoception is our ability to understand and interpret bodily signals—an ability often overlooked in our digital age, where external devices can almost too conveniently fill that role.\nIn a world awash with data, people are increasingly disconnected from their own bodies. The omnipresence of technology offers us endless feedback loops—GPS tells us where to go, smartwatches alert us when to move, and chatbots offer near-instant emotional support. Yet, there’s a critical trade-off happening here. As our dependence on external systems grows, our intrinsic systems for self-regulation and emotional coping may atrophy. Think of it like relying on GPS so much that you lose the ability to read a map or navigate by the stars.\nWhen it comes to anxiety and depression, the effect of this is profound. Lack of interoceptive awareness can exacerbate these conditions by detaching individuals from their own physiological signals. They’re like sailors lost at sea, their compasses going haywire. However, the silver lining is that interoceptive skills can be honed through practice—akin to tuning a musical instrument to hit the right emotional notes. Training in heartbeat detection, for instance, can literally ‘re-calibrate’ the nervous system, decreasing anxiety levels and offering a deeper sense of emotional balance.\nIn essence, this ‘sixth sense’ isn’t some mystical concept but a trainable skill that, when optimized, can serve as a firewall against emotional volatility. While technology can indeed offer a useful scaffold, we should be cautious not to let it replace our intrinsic capacities. Reclaiming and honing your interoceptive skills is like developing your own personal operating system—one that’s finely tuned to your unique needs, limitations, and potentials.\n\nRead more at: [Interoception: The hidden ‘sixth sense’ that is key to our well-being](https://nesslabs.com/interoception\nGo one level up : Body MOC\nYou may also be interested in: How to develop expert level Jedi powers"},"Notes/The-Unmeasurable-Certainty-of-End-of-Life-Dreams":{"title":"The Unmeasurable Certainty of End of Life Dreams","links":["Notes/Doctors,-Death,-and-Dignity--A-Contrarian-Perspective"],"tags":["end-of-life","medical","medical-paradox","dreams","human-experience"],"content":"In the realm of data-driven healthcare, where algorithms and scans often dictate treatment paths, comes a phenomenon that defies measurement: end-of-life dreams. Clinicians have reported that when a patient experiences such a dream—often of departed loved ones beckoning them—it is almost always a signal that their time is near, typically within 24 to 48 hours. It’s an observation that is remarkably consistent, yet evades the quantitative scrutiny commonly associated with medical diagnoses.\nFrom a medical perspective, it’s a paradox. Here we have a deeply personal, immeasurable experience pointing to an imminent, measurable event—death. The clash between subjective experience and objective data forces us to ponder on the limitations of contemporary healthcare that’s driven by evidence and technology.\nAnd personally, I’m awestruck by this. That something so intangible can consistently foreshadow an event as definite as death intrigues me. It’s a reminder that despite the leaps and bounds of medical technology, there are elements of the human experience that remain beyond the scope of quantification.\nIt challenges the medical community to not just rely on what can be quantified but to also consider the qualitative, experiential indicators of a person’s state. This leads me to ponder about the importance of holistic approaches that acknowledge both the measurable and the immeasurable aspects of human life.\nIt makes you wonder: Could there be a space in modern medicine for integrating these ‘unmeasurable certainties’ in a way that complements the existing evidence-based framework?\n\nRead more at: End-of-Life Dreams | Commonweal Magazine\nYou may also be interested in: Doctors, Death, and Dignity- A Contrarian Perspective"},"Notes/The-Untapped-Potential-of-Rodeola-Rosacea-in-High-Intensity-Workouts":{"title":"The Untapped Potential of Rodeola Rosacea in High-Intensity Workouts","links":["Exercises-MOC","Notes/The-Principle-of-a-Minimum-Effective-Workout-(Blog-Post)"],"tags":["optimization","supplements","high-intensity-training","cortisol","cortisol-modulation"],"content":"Curiosity breeds innovation. That’s something both Dr. Lane Norton and Dr. Andy Galpin seem to embrace. Their exploration of Rodeola Rosacea as a cortisol modulator positions this supplement as not just another item in the burgeoning wellness industry but as a nuanced tool for athletic performance.\nHere’s the kicker: cortisol modulation is a double-edged sword. On one side, it’s known for its ‘fight or flight’ functions; on the other, excessive cortisol can trigger fatigue and even impair performance. Rodeola Rosacea steps in like a seasoned conductor directing a complex orchestra: it neither suppresses nor elevates cortisol but modulates it, optimizing your stress hormone levels to keep you at peak performance.\nI can’t help but relate this to the “Goldilocks Zone” in hormesis. Too little stress, and there’s no growth; too much, and you risk damage. Striking that optimal zone is an art form, akin to finding the perfect intensity in a high-impact workout. It’s still an open book, but what we’re starting to see is the influence of neurons and adrenal glands in this modulation process.\nRemember, the scientific community is still out on a limb, figuring out the ‘how’ behind Rodeola Rosacea’s effects. It’s a bit like stepping into a cave without a flashlight—venturing into the unknown, albeit a calculated risk backed by emerging research.\nSo, for someone always looking for the next optimization hack (that’s me!), keeping an eye on Rodeola Rosacea could be similar to keeping tabs on a promising rookie in a sports draft.

However, a recent recount by Tao Lin in his article “The Story of Autism” provides a compelling case for how diet, exercise, and social interaction—essentially lifestyle changes—can influence the condition positively.\nThe journey detailed from 2001 to 2008 was marked by significant shifts in physical and mental health achieved through seemingly straightforward avenues like eating better and being more physically active. The tale highlights an often overlooked but poignant truth: our bodily health and mental health are tightly interwoven, and shifts in one can lead to improvements in the other.\nHere’s where I personally resonate with this. Diet and exercise are not just about achieving a summer-ready body or clocking in that elusive personal best. They are agents of change that have the ability to make measurable impacts on our neurological health. It’s an aspect I emphasize heavily in my coaching. When we only look through the lens of conventional treatments, we might overlook these natural, accessible methods that can create remarkable changes.\nImagine, if you will, a garden full of different types of plants. Each plant has its own unique set of requirements: soil pH, amount of sunlight, and type of fertilizer. Conventional treatments are akin to general-purpose fertilizers, good for many but not ideal for all. Dietary changes and exercise are like specialized nutrients that, when applied, can bring about a bloom that you didn’t think was possible in that garden.\nSocial interaction, even through digital means like blogging, shouldn’t be discounted either. It acts as the “sunlight” that helps bring about a balanced growth, especially in an increasingly virtual world.\nTo sum it up, the holistic approach isn’t just a buzzword; it’s an arsenal of tools that can significantly improve the quality of life across different areas, including conditions like autism. We, as health coaches, aren’t just sculpting bodies; we’re shaping lives.\n\nRead more at: The Story of Autism: How We Got Here, How We Heal by Tao Lin ~dacten-sidlyn - by ~bidbel\nGo one level up : Mental Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: What to do for your health when you cannot exercise anymore"},"Notes/The-Value-Proposition-of-Cohorts":{"title":"The Value Proposition of Cohorts","links":[],"tags":["-cohort-courses-online-community-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nAuthor\nurl:\nTweet url: https://twitter.com/julia_saxena/status/1354790890875793410\nKey Idea §\n\nWhat draws students to cohort-based courses: Accountability + Community + Direct Access to an Expert That’s what the value proposition should evolve around.

A little muscle ache here, a tinge of emotional unease there; these are not setbacks but rather milestones marking our progress. If you ever catch yourself actively seeking comfort, pause and consider: is this nurturing your growth or hindering it?\nFor me, the allure of comfort is an existential crisis in disguise. It’s the antithesis of what I believe aids true personal growth. It is almost a paradox; while comfort brings immediate pleasure, it sows the seeds of long-term stagnation.\nThe narrative that discomfort equals failure needs reevaluation. When discomfort rears its head, especially in moderate doses, that’s not your cue to abandon ship. Instead, it’s an invitation to engage more deeply. In the fitness world, for example, muscle ache is often the precursor to muscle growth and increased resilience. In a similar vein, moderate emotional discomfort often precedes noticeable personal development.\nThis perspective turns the conventional wisdom on its head. Rather than seeing discomfort as an obstacle to overcome, it should be seen as a guide leading us towards our goals. So the next time you find yourself in uncomfortable terrain, whether emotional or physical, take it as a sign—you’re on the right path to growth.\n\nRead more at: Get Comfortable with Feeling Uncomfortable - Behavioral Scientist\nYou may also be interested in: Seek challenges and go out of your comfort zone"},"Notes/The-Virtues-of-Storytelling-and-Scarcity-in-Life's-Stages":{"title":"The Virtues of Storytelling and Scarcity in Life's Stages","links":["Notes/Doctors,-Death,-and-Dignity--A-Contrarian-Perspective"],"tags":["life-stages","emotional-intelligence","storytelling","career","career-development"],"content":"Everyone acknowledges that fear and greed are universal emotions. This is an enlightening perspective when you think about the stories we tell and how they shape us. Take Richard Feynman, for example. He understood that stories live on, granting us a form of immortality. When I recount stories from my clients’ lives, it’s not just a coaching session—it’s also an archive of meaningful human experiences.\nDavid Brooks’ idea of “resume virtues” vs “eulogy virtues” adds another layer to this. It begs us to question what really counts in life. Resume virtues are for the now, the accomplishments that get you ahead. But eulogy virtues are for forever, the qualities people remember you by. It’s a humbling reminder that long-term legacy outshines short-term achievements.\nThe career advice to “wave your arms and be noticed” early on makes sense. That’s the stage of life where you’re trying to carve out a space for yourself. But as you transition into later stages, the tables turn. What becomes most valuable is scarcity—your unique skill set, the stories only you can tell, the wisdom that comes from years of experience.\nThis entire discussion makes me think about the different seasons of life. We’re always so focused on the “now,” but perhaps we need to adopt a more holistic view. What stories are we telling now that will live on after us?

The suggestion to keep walking until the day becomes interesting presents a simple yet transformative idea for pushing through that barrier.\nMuch like my personal favorite activity, walking, this rule taps into the intuitive understanding that physical motion can jumpstart mental motion. Whether it’s the rhythm of your steps, the changing scenery, or the subtle influences of nature, walking has a way of jostling loose the thoughts that felt so stuck when you were sitting at your desk.\nThis resonates particularly well with the notion that our bodies and minds are intricately connected. A lack of ideas or a feeling of being stuck might be symptomatic of a body that also feels stuck. So, the act of walking not only serves to change your physical location but also shifts your mental landscape.\nRemember, next time you’re up against a mental wall, don’t just think your way out—walk your way out. It’s not about aimless wandering but about purposeful exploration, both of the world around you and the one within you. And based on my own love for walking, I can’t recommend this enough as a strategy to revitalize your day and your mind.\n\nRead more at: My favourite rules &amp; razors\nYou may also be interested in: The Temporary Wisdom of Fads- Nordic Walking Edition"},"Notes/The-Weight-of-Expectations--From-Child-Athlete-to-Curious-Explorer":{"title":"The Weight of Expectations: From Child Athlete to Curious Explorer","links":["Notes/The-Lost-Art-of-Play--Child's-Work,-Adult's-Gain"],"tags":["childhood","emotional-baggage","performance","personal-growth"],"content":"The relationship between parental expectations and a child’s fear of failure isn’t just a topic of academic interest; it’s a lived experience for many, myself included. As a former child athlete, I can relate to the psychological toll that high expectations can place on young minds. Although unintentional, these expectations set a stage where the fear of not meeting them looms large, potentially causing lasting emotional imprints.\nThe question then becomes: how do we move forward and reframe this fear into something more constructive, like increments of curiosity? One approach is to dissect the monolithic concept of ‘success’ or ‘failure’ into smaller, more manageable pieces—each being an opportunity for learning and growth. This isn’t about diminishing the importance of goals or ambitions; it’s about providing room to breathe, to explore, and to make mistakes without severe emotional consequences.\nThe interesting part is that this shift in mindset can be liberating not just for the individual but also for the family dynamic. Parents, often unintentionally, may also feel unburdened when the narrative shifts from high-stakes performance to a series of exploratory steps.\nIn the context of health and wellness, this reframing is akin to transforming an intimidating workout regimen into a series of enjoyable activities. It’s a bit like taking the ‘work’ out of the ‘workout,’ converting a fear-driven endeavor into a curiosity-fueled adventure.\nIn essence, transforming fear into curiosity offers a pathway to heal old wounds, shift entrenched perspectives, and navigate life with a greater sense of freedom and authenticity.\n\nRead more at: Turning Fear of Failure into Increments of Curiosity - Ness Labs\nYou may also be interested in: The Lost Art of Play- Child’s Work, Adult’s Gain"},"Notes/The-Wine-Blueprint":{"title":"The Wine Blueprint","links":["Maps/Culture-MOC"],"tags":[],"content":"up:: Culture MOC\ntags::\nnovelty::\nlink: Wine Blueprint Book Landing Page\nWhat it is:\nIt’s a resource to help people understand wine\nWhy it’s interesting:\nI like the science of wine, it’s always intruiging"},"Notes/The-Witness-BF-Skinner":{"title":"The Witness BF Skinner","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"observer and observed\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSUlTuF_Wy0"},"Notes/The-Word-Lila-in-Sanskrit-and-play":{"title":"The Word Lila in Sanskrit and play","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Word Lila in Sanskrit and play §\nLila in Sanskrit\nAs play sport\nThe source of reality\nThis is more play and spirituality"},"Notes/The-ability-to-endure-hardships":{"title":"The ability to endure hardships","links":["Maps/Psychology-MOC","Notes/Resiliency-Routines-help-regain-a-sense-of-control"],"tags":["-hardships-","-suffering-","-resilience-"],"content":"Provided that it is not accompanied by humiliation, discomfort can be endured for long periods without complaint.\nFor proof of this, we have only took look to the example of the many soldiers and explorers who have, over the centuries, willingly tolerated privations far exceeding those suffered by the poorest members of their societies, so long as they were sustained throughout their hardships by an awareness of esteem in which they were held by others.\n\nRead more at: The Happiness Lottery - Rob Henderson’s Newsletter\nGo one level up : Psychology MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Resiliency Routines help regain a sense of control"},"Notes/The-act-of-logging-itself-(concept)":{"title":"The act of logging itself (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The act of logging itself (concept) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea §\n\nThe idea here is that even if you never revisit your you log, it’s still useful and there are still benefits to having it\nThe benefits of this are self contained\nMeaning even if you never extract data from your logs\nThe fact that you did the log and it exists it good\n"},"Notes/The-agri-business-model-needs-to-change":{"title":"The agri business model needs to change","links":[],"tags":["-on/agriculture-business-on/permaculture-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThe Modern Acre\n227: Decoding Soil Biology With Adrián Ferrero, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Biome Makers\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62aecb8f62ce94f7a96d8d47\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nInteresting for agri\nChemical fertilizer prices go up\nOkay- there’s super high yields\nBut the business model is not profitable\nSo you gotta make some tradeoffs now\nRural areas are dropping in people\nBecause the business model is not good\nWe need different kinds of agriculture\nSee also §"},"Notes/The-art-of-the-biography":{"title":"The art of the biography","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The art of the biography\nhttps://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/894/the-art-of-biography-no-2-david-mccullough"},"Notes/The-benefit-is-at-the-beginning":{"title":"The benefit is at the beginning","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/on/walking","tags/mindset"],"tags":["permanent-note","on/walking","mindset"],"content":"topic: 202111250933- The benefit is at the beginning\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#on/walking#mindset §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThe whole world has the idea that 10,000 steps a day is the goal.\nBut 10,000 steps has its origins in marketing, not in science.

There are a few things to keep in mind when you’re choosing foods for recovery.\nFirst, you want to make sure you’re getting enough protein to help repair and rebuild muscle tissue. Second, you want to focus on anti-inflammatory foods to help reduce swelling and pain. And lastly, you want to make sure you’re getting plenty of vitamins and minerals to support the overall healing process.\n\nProtein\n\nProtein is essential for repairing and rebuilding muscle tissue. If you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough protein in your diet.\nThere are all sorts of ways to get protein in your diet. You can get it from meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, and plants. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, you can get protein from tofu, tempeh, beans, lentils, and nuts.\n\nVitamin C\n\nVitamin C is important for collagen production. Collagen is a protein that helps to repair and rebuild tissue. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough vitamin C in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in vitamin C. Some of the best include citrus fruits, bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale.\n\nVitamin A\n\nVitamin A is important for cell growth and repair. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough vitamin A in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in vitamin A. Some of the best include sweet potatoes, carrots, dark leafy greens, and squash.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are important for inflammation. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Some of the best include salmon, tuna, sardines, flaxseeds, and chia seeds.\n\nAntioxidants\n\nAntioxidants are important for reducing inflammation. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough antioxidants in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in antioxidants. Some of the best include berries, dark chocolate, green tea, and turmeric.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when you’re choosing foods for recovery.

When we worked on assembly lines and in big corporate offices, projects made sense because order and linearity reigned. But today, more and more of us are working with ideas, and ideas need room to grow, evolve, and have a chance to fully form into whatever they might be becoming.\n\nEfforts are freeing.\n\nEfforts don’t need a deadline §\nProjects require deadlines. But efforts are flexible, fluid, and adaptable. They can have no deadlines, hard deadlines, soft deadlines—and likely various deadlines for various versions of the same idea outputted to different mediums in different final forms.\n\nEfforts are fluid.\n\nEfforts don’t have a clear size §\nThey can be bigger than projects, or smaller, and oftentimes their size is hard to know.

Hint: it’s not knowledge.\nAnd how about elite sales teams? How do they continually make critical sales while others can’t even get their foot in the door?\nThe answer?\nTheir recovery time. The speed in which they rebound from setbacks and mistakes.\nPicture a tennis player in the biggest game of her life. She has just hit a weak backhand and she knows it.\nIn the immediate moments that follow, we see her re-center physically into the “ready” position, facing the net squarely, ready for whatever type of ball comes back.\nBut an even more important factor is whether she re-centers mentally and gets to the ready mind position in time…\n…because here’s the thing. If she’s still upset over her last mistake when the next ball comes, she will smash the ball into the net.\nIf you don’t recover fast enough, your small mistakes or setbacks can spiral into bigger ones.\n\nChampions know this.\nHow fast is your recovery time?\nWhen you experience a setback - a rejection from a prospective client, getting admonished by your boss, losing your cool when talking to your teenager - how long does it take you to re-center yourself, mentally and emotionally?\nThe answer depends on the strength of your Saboteurs.\nEvery Saboteur pounces into action in response to your inevitable mistakes, failures and setbacks in the game of life.\nDepending on which Saboteur you’ve got …\n…the anxiety-fueling Saboteurs such as Hyper-Vigilant, Controller, Stickler, and Hyper-Achiever blow the negative consequences of the setback out of proportion.\n…the Victim drowns you in self-pity and might even cause you to give up.\n…the Avoider shields you in denial, resulting in inaction.\n…and so on.\nIn short, your Saboteurs waste a ton of your mental and emotional energy which in turn prolongs your recovery.\nIn my last email, I showed you how to weaken your Saboteurs by “taking your hand off the hot stove” — acknowledging your mistakes and moving on.\nBut how do you train your mind to respond reliably, even in the toughest circumstances?\nHow do you develop the ability to handle adversity with a clear, calm, and laser-focused mindset?\nThis takes mental fitness.\nMy research has studied over 500,000 participants in 50 countries, including Fortune 100 CEOs, Stanford students and elite athletes. It shows that mental fitness is the greatest predictor of how happy you are and how well you perform against your potential.\nSome fascinating findings from my research:\n\n\nPeople with high mental fitness take fewer sick days than their co-workers and are less likely to become burned-out.\n\n\nSalespeople with high mental fitness sell 37% more than teams with lower relative mental fitness.\n\n\nCEOs with high mental fitness lead teams that are more likely to praise their workplace as a high-performance environment.\n\n\nMental fitness leads to lower levels of stress hormones, better immune system function, better sleep and smaller risk of hypertension, diabetes or stroke.\n\n\nMental fitness can actually help you live longer!\nI have a lot more to tell you about mental fitness, including the exact steps you need to take to build “mental muscle”, but this email is already too long!

Now more than ever, we are starting to witness the neural formation of habits.\nMy Thoughts\nA habit is a mirror, it gives what you give it, and what you were given is what you’ll give. It’s the immediate expression of the law of Cause and Effect\nChange your mind to change your brain to change your mind. Reminds of a tautological Feedback Loop.\nJust like Newton’s Law of Conservation states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; so with habits are that for every action, taking the same action again will require less effort. Neural connections were made and repeated actions optimize them. They become more efficient.\n“Neurons that fire together wire together” - Hebb’s Rule\n“Passing mental states become lasting neural traits” - maybe Rick Hanson\nWe can only surmise as to why, but to me it has clear evolutionary advantages. Any action we take burns calories and uses either our physical muscles, our mental muscles (like the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a crucial player in willpower management), or both. By making a repeated action easier, less energy is used, less willpower is required, and fewer calories are burned—all of which lead to a better chance of survival.\nSee also: The truest habit metaphors are additive - v1"},"Notes/The-neural-formation-of-habits-is-additive":{"title":"The neural formation of habits is additive","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","Notes/Newton's-Laws-of-Motion"],"tags":["habit"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit\nThe neural formation of habits is additive §\nI attended a presentation of “Portraits of the Mind” by Carl Schoonover.

I guess I just assumed I would age gracefully like my mother and grandmother. But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that aging is not something that happens to you, it’s something that happens in you. The aging process is different for everyone, and it’s something that you have to be proactive about if you want to stay active into old age.\nHere are 5 things that you can do to stay active into old age:\n\nKeep moving\n\nThis one is pretty self-explanatory. The more you move, the more active you will be. But it’s not just about physical activity. It’s also about mental and emotional activity. Keep your mind active by learning new things, trying new experiences, and staying curious. And keep your emotions active by express them, connect with others, and stay engaged with the world around you.\n\nDon’t buy into the age myth\n\nWe live in a youth-obsessed culture where age is seen as a negative. But the truth is, age is just a number. It’s how you feel on the inside that counts. So don’t buy into the age myth that says you have to slow down as you get older. Instead, focus on staying active and engaged with the world around you.\n\nFind a coach or mentor\n\nA coach or mentor can help you stay accountable to your goals and help you stay on track. They can also offer guidance and support when you need it. Find someone who is where you want to be in life and ask them for help.\n\nConnect with others\n\nConnection is key to staying active into old age. Connect with others who share your interests and values. Find a community of like-minded people who can support and encourage you.\n\nMake your health a priority\n\nYour health is your most important asset. So make it a priority. Invest in your health by eating healthy, exercising, and getting regular checkups. And don’t forget to take care of your mental health too.\nAging is a natural process that happens to everyone. But it doesn’t have to mean a decline in your health or your ability to stay active. By following these five tips, you can stay active into old age.\nThe aging process is something that is different for everyone, and it is something that you have to be proactive about if you want to stay active into old age. You can age gracefully like your mother and grandmother if you are proactive about it."},"Notes/The-top-5-exercises-you-can-do-when-you're-injured":{"title":"The top 5 exercises you can do when you're injured","links":["Maps/Efforts-MOC","tags/effort","tags/output"],"tags":["effort","output"],"content":"up:: Efforts MOC\ntags::#effort\nrank:: 4\nOutputs:\n- output::#output/\nThe top 5 NEW exercises you can do when you’re injured\nIt’s no secret that when you’re injured, it can be really tough to get back into the swing of things. It’s hard to know what exercises you can do when you’re injured and feeling pain. And, of course, you don’t want to do anything that will make the injury worse.\nBut did you know that one of the best things you can do for your body when you’re injured is to start moving again? It may sound counter-intuitive, but it’s true!\nWhen you’re injured, your body goes into protection mode. It’s natural to want to protect the injured area and keep it from moving. But this can actually lead to more pain.\nYour body is designed to move. It’s made to be active. When you expose yourself to new movements, your body doesn’t have the same fear associated with them. The body can adapt to many things, and you can trust your own body to get better.\nSo, if you’re dealing with an injury, don’t be afraid to start moving again. Try some new exercises and trust your body to heal itself.\nExposing your body to new movements will help it to adapt and heal. Trust your body to get better, and don’t be afraid to move.\nHere are my five favorite exercises to explore when you’re injured\n\nGo dancing\n\nTry going dancing. For many people, it is the perfect way to move, feel socially supported, and keep their minds sharp. Dancing is a great way to get your body moving and to feel supported by others. It’s also a great way to keep your mind sharp. So if you’re dealing with an injury, don’t be afraid to give it a try.\n\nWalking in nature:\n\nWalking is a great way to stay active while you’re injured. It’s low-impact, so it won’t aggravate your injury, and it’s a great way to get some fresh air and sunshine. Just listening to the crunch of leaves below your feet and feeling the sun on your skin can help you to feel better. So get out there and start moving!\n\nSwimming:\n\nSwimming is a great way to get some low-impact exercise. It’s almost impossible to injure yourself if you’re just swimming for fun. Plus it can let you explore bodily movements that would be impossible out of the water.\n\nTry a martial art:\n\nFor some people Tai Chi is great. It helps your balance and flexibility. It can be meditative and relaxing.For others something new like Judo helps them learn a lot about their body and different positions.\nStudying a new martial art can also be a great way to gain a new perspective on your body. It can help you to understand how your body moves and how to use its natural strengths.\n\nCrawling and animal flow\n\nTry crawling and animal movements. Can you even remember the last time you were crawling? We did it all the time as kids, and then as we got older we just stopped doing that altogether. But there are a lot of benefits to moving on your hands and palms again! Crawling helps to improve your body awareness and proprioception (the ability to know where your body is in space). It also helps to strengthen the muscles in your shoulders, arms, and hands. And it’s not just good for your physical health - crawling can also help to reduce stress and anxiety. When you move your body in new ways, it helps to release tension and feel more relaxed. So don’t be afraid to get down on all fours and start crawling around! Your body will thank you for it.\nIt’s about exploration §\nA key thing to remember here is that you’re not doing these exercises INSTEAD. These are not poor man’s versions of your favorite activities.\nYou are doing these to explore, and to expose your body to movement again.\nYour goal here is to have the right mindset- and to tell yourself, “I am moving my body because I am safe, my body can recover, and I don’t need to be afraid of moving too much”"},"Notes/The-top-5-most-overlooked-things-when-recovering-from-injury":{"title":"The top 5 most overlooked things when recovering from injury","links":["Maps/Efforts-MOC","tags/effort","tags/output"],"tags":["effort","output"],"content":"up:: Efforts MOC\ntags::#effort\nrank:: 4\nOutputs:\n- output::#output/\nThe top 5 most overlooked things when it comes to recovery\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day of life and overlook the things that are important. The things that we should be paying attention to.\nWhen it comes to recovery from an injury, there are a few things that people always forget or overlook. Yes, they remember to see the doctor and to visit a physical therapist. But after those two main ones, everyone just seems to assume that things will take care of themselves.\nBut the truth is there’s a lot that’s overlooked in the recovery process. And they can take you all the way from where you are now to full recovery if you’re not careful.\nHere are the top 5 things that are often overlooked in the recovery process:\n\nYour mindset\n\nThe way you think about your injury and your recovery can really impact the way your body heals. If you’re constantly stressing and worrying about your injury, your body is going to respond accordingly and the healing process will be slower.\nBut if you’re able to stay positive and believe that you’ll recover, your body will respond in kind and the healing will happen more quickly.\n\nYour diet\n\nWhat you eat plays a big role in the healing process. If you’re not getting enough nutrients, your body won’t be able to heal as quickly.\n\nYour sleep\n\nGetting enough sleep is crucial for recovery. When you’re asleep, your body is able to repair itself and heal.\n\nYour activity level\n\nIt’s important to find the right balance when it comes to activity level. If you’re doing too much, you could risk re-injuring yourself. But if you’re not doing enough, your body won’t get the movement it needs to heal properly.\n\nYour support system\n\nHaving a strong support system is so important during the recovery process. Whether it’s your family, friends, or a professional coach, having people to lean on will make the process a lot easier.\nIf you or someone you know is recovering from an injury, make sure to keep these things in mind. They can make all the difference in the recovery process.\nRecovery from an injury can be a long and difficult process, but it’s important to remember that it’s not impossible. If you focus on taking care of yourself and following the tips above, you’ll be well on your way to a full recovery."},"Notes/The-top-idea-in-your-mind":{"title":"The top idea in your mind","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The top idea in your mind §\nBy Paul Graham\nYou know that feeling when you’re working on a problem\nthen can’t get it\nthen you do something else\nand it just comes to you\nThat’s what Paul Graham calls the idea in the top of your mind\nIt’s what your brain will work on subconsciously.\nSo you have to put the right problem on the top of your mind\nIn fitness\nWe have burst of eagerness and focus\nThen it stops becoming interesting\nUse that burst\nNot to work out more\nBut to lay the foundation for habits"},"Notes/The-transtheoretical-model":{"title":"The transtheoretical model","links":["Notes/Article-Sections-(for-the-website)"],"tags":[],"content":"What is The transtheoretical model §\nIt’s about change\nIt’s the stages of change\nI think I can use this in Article Sections (for the website)"},"Notes/The-trap-of-giving-up-religion-for-science":{"title":"The trap of giving up religion for science","links":["Notes/How-religion-failed-to-compete","Notes/Why-philosophy-is-better-than-science"],"tags":["-modernism-on/religion-on/epistemology-science--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nNassim Nicholas Taleb\nOn Christianity\nurl: https://medium.com/incerto/on-christianity-b7fecde866ec\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nIronically, modernists fall for what I have called the opiate of the middle classes[15], that is social science and stock market speculation.

And a lot of that is non conscious. The approach that I like to take is to try to give the non conscious brain signals that are going to be more consistent with your goals, signals that are going to tell your brain to regulate things in a more slimming direction.

And it’s always the same fixable mistakes I’m correcting:\n\n\nNo USP Successful products and services offer a unique selling point. So why would successful articles be different? Whether it’s a unique angle, point, experience, style or tone, your article needs to offer something that others don’t. Else, it gets lost in the crowd.\n\n\nNot adding credibility The world is full of articles by people without the authority to write them. You know, those who made $10 on UpWork and then write the ‘how to make money on Upwork’… If you have credibility, get it up top. It tells the reader you know your shit.\n\n\nNo opening hook Many writers skip the intro, believing “readers want the main points so I won’t waste their time.” Wrong. The intro is a great tool to grab a reader’s attention. Use a bold statement, relatable experience, or data points that make the reader go “oh, wow.”\n\n\nBigger isn’t better Often, writers think big words and convoluted sentences means ‘smart’ writing. It’s the opposite and typically makes your work harder to read. And when you make it hard for the reader, they won’t be reading much longer. Simple is best.\n\n\n75 Confusing structure A story without direction gets lost quick. The best writing takes the reader on a clear journey, with a defined beginning, middle and end, and a defined result. Tip: Map this out before you begin writing. You need to be clear of the path too.\n\nOverformatting Bold, italics, lists and pull quotes are fun. But, overdo it and your writing becomes a visual mess. Zoom out your screen, and view your writing from afar - you’ll notice immediately if it’s too noisy. If in doubt, tone it down.\n"},"Notes/Tithonia-diversifolia":{"title":"Tithonia diversifolia","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tithonia diversifolia\nhttps://garden.org/plants/view/115816/Mexican-Sunflower-Tithonia-diversifolia/"},"Notes/To-Predict-Chronic-Pain-Look-at-the-Brain":{"title":"To Predict Chronic Pain Look at the Brain","links":["Predicting-transition-to-chronic-pain"],"tags":[],"content":"To Predict Chronic Pain Look at the Brain §\nContext §\nMany people experience a lot of chronic pain.\nIt’s frustrating because it’s invisible pain too\nSome facts §\nPain rarely correlates with MRI or posture\nMost people get over acute pain after a few days.\nSome people can develop chronic pain\nsome quotes §\n“Taken together, these ideas can be simplified as a lowered mesolimbic threshold for the conscious perception of pain, which functionally renders the brain addicted to pain.

One approach that grabbed my attention is setting up a 30-day challenge—specifically a Keto challenge. While the idea itself isn’t groundbreaking, the execution can make all the difference. For instance, having each participant post a daily photo of their Keto meal not only encourages commitment but also fosters a sense of camaraderie.\nWhat intrigues me even more is the idea of focusing on a specific niche—like Keto for Dads. It’s as if the universe is whispering, “Go narrower, dig deeper.” By creating a specialized challenge such as “KetoDadsUnite,” we could potentially elevate a simple diet challenge into a transformative experience for a targeted community. It’s like establishing a ritual, a common practice that bonds individuals and turns them into a tribe.\nHowever, it’s critical to remember the implications of initiating such a challenge. Beyond just food photos, how will it impact their daily lives? What support systems will they need? When we aim to build a community, we must be ready to be stewards of that space, guiding and engaging with our members through their ups and downs.\nGiven the right strategy and execution, a simple challenge can become a community ritual.

And when it was given to us the first thing I noticed is that it came in a very pretty but very small pot. They told us that it was going to fruit soon, so that meant it was probably about 2-3 years old.\nI knew it was only a matter of time before I would have to transplant it. Since the pot was so small.\nI’ve put it off for quite a while, and now it’s time.\nHow Transplanting Helps a Plant\nThis plant really needed some help.\nOver time, I could see that it was starting to get stressed.\nEspecially compared to my other Calamansi plant.\nThe leaves were starting to get a bit yellow, and one day when I came out to give it some water, a whole bunch of leaves just fell off.\nThankfully, it survived long enough for me to get my butt into gear and switch it out to a better container.\nOne thing that really is annoying about plants is overwatering, underwatering, pot boundedness will all show the same signs.\nWhen plants become pot bound, they don’t really have room to grow anymore.\nThey’ll start to wilt and show signs of distress like yellowing and falling leaves.\n(I think it’s because they’re absorbing more moisture than the pot can hold)\nSo I want to give it more room to grow.\nPutting in into a bigger box lets the roots grow out.\nThis actually works better when the plant is younger.\nSteps in Transplanting\n\nRemove the plant from its pot\n\nThis one took a while because I had waited for so long. By now, the plant’s roots had hugged the side of the pot and it was so compact\n\nCheck the roots\nDig a hole\nPosition the plant\nBackfill with soil\nMake a raised bank to direct the water\nMulch\n\nMaking my Own Boxes (blog post)\nBe careful of transplants shock\nI am worried about transplant shock. This Calamansi seemed a bit pot bound and not so strong.\nI also don’t know what was in the soil that was given to us since it’s a gift.\nI used a mix of garden soil and ipa (rice husk) to give it good drainage.\nAnd then I put a layer of our homemade compost\nas well as some ipa as a final mulching\n\nIf you transplant a plant when it can’t handle it, it may struggle to thrive.\nIt needs to stay hyrdrated so that the roots don’t dry out\n\nTheorizing §\nIn temperate climates, the suggestion is to transplant it when the plant is dormant\n(so like winter)\nBut that doesn’t really apply to the Philippines\nSo when to transplant plants in tropical climates?\n\nThis is something I still can’t find any good research on.\n\nIf the roots shouldn’t dry out, then I guess rainy season would be

This vast but often overlooked cornucopia is not just about the sumptuous array of colors on our plates, but about understanding the chain from soil to plate and its implications for nutritional value.\nThe dichotomy between specialty and commodity crops is more than a classification; it’s a reflection of our societal values and the economic underpinnings that dictate the accessibility of nutritious food. On one side, we have the grains and oilseeds, the stalwarts of long-term food security with their impressive shelf lives. On the other, the specialty crops—fruits, vegetables, and nuts—offer a burst of nutrition but often come with a ticking clock of perishability.\nPersonal Insights on Quality and Nutrition\nAs a health coach, peering into the supply chain’s intricacies is more than an exercise in knowledge—it’s an essential practice for advocating quality nutrition. Recognizing the storage challenges of fresh produce versus the shelf-stability of grains can enlighten our strategies around diet, nutrition, and even food security.\nReflecting on my own kitchen, the contrast between the long-standing rice grains and the fleeting freshness of parsley is a microcosm of our global food system. This understanding pushes me to educate and encourage a more sustainable, diverse diet that goes beyond the dominant crops. It’s about making informed choices that not only nourish our bodies but also respect the complex dynamics of food production and supply.\nBy comprehensively understanding the supply chain, we can empower ourselves and others to value food diversity not just for the sake of variety, but for its profound impact on health and the environment. It’s about bridging the gap between what is readily available and what is nutritionally enriching, thus fostering a food system that supports health, sustainability, and the economy.\n\nRead more at: One size does not fit all when it comes to crops\nYou may also be interested in: Glocalization and Supply chains"},"Notes/Understanding-the-habit-cycle-and-habitual-cues":{"title":"Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","tags/on/pd","Notes/How-Atomic-Habits-fit-into-the-conversation-on-habits","Notes/Antifragility","Notes/Resiliency-Routines-help-regain-a-sense-of-control","Notes/Charting-out-habit-cycles-in-my-life-circa-2013"],"tags":["habit","on/pd"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit#on/pd\nUnderstanding the habit cycle and habitual cues §\nThe Habit Cycle §\nCharles Duhigg made popular a three-step process of habit formation. Later, James Clear argued for a fourth step “craving”, which I always felt was missing as well. Here’s the cycle as I see it:\n\nCue (Make it Obvious vs Invisible)\nCraving (Make it Attractive vs Unattractive) - timing is important\nRoutine (Make it Easy vs Difficult)\nReward (Make it Satisfying vs Unsatisfying) - Behaviors that are immediately rewarded get repeated. Behaviors that are immediately punished don’t get repeated. That’s why you need to make it enjoyable in the moment. One way is tying your identity to it. Frame your rewards.\n\nFor more, see How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits.\nDuhigg calls the most important habits “Keystone Habits”. These are the special habits, that by doing, make all the other habits that much easier to accomplish. I’ve identified my keystone habits, which I’m coining as “resiliency routines” because my mindset has been forever altered by the concept of Antifragility.

They remind me that before turning to the shelves of a supplement store, I should explore the rich tapestry of nutrients available in my own kitchen or local market.

Here was an endeavor to nullify the divisive constructs of nationality and religion, forming a community of ‘Liberi’—free people united under the banner of equality and democracy. Misson’s vision, whether myth or reality, reflects a radical attempt to construct an egalitarian society amidst the lawlessness of the high seas.\nReflecting on Libertasia challenges my own preconceptions of governance and social contracts. In my practice, I’ve always been drawn to the concept that a cohesive system is possible even within the most unconventional settings. Libertasia, as a prototype of such a system, suggests that even those who live on the fringes, branded as renegades, possess the intrinsic desire for a fair and just society.\nThis story, nestled in the annals of pirate lore, stands as a powerful allegory for societal innovation. It serves as a reminder that sometimes, the seeds of a utopian society are found in the most barren soils, where freedom and democracy are not just lofty ideals, but survival mechanisms.\nIn this light, the tale of Libertasia isn’t just about piracy—it’s about the yearning for a community where every voice is heard, and every individual is valued. It’s a compelling narrative that holds a mirror up to our own efforts at creating inclusive environments and begs the question: Are there spaces in our modern world where we can cast off the old to construct the new?\nAs I ponder on Libertasia, it reaffirms the belief that the blueprint for a utopian society often lies outside the margins of conventional thought, waiting to be discovered in the unlikeliest of chronicles.\n\nRead more at: Pirates of Madagascar - The LRB Podcast | Acast\nYou may also be interested in: The Luxury of Disconnection- Rethinking Vacation in a Non-Stop World"},"Notes/Vagus-Nerve-speaks-up":{"title":"Vagus Nerve speaks up","links":[],"tags":["-nueroscience-on/biology-body-gut-mind-body-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nOn Being with Krista Tippett\nKimberley Wilson — Whole Body Mental Health\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/6289a7ba3782e70d243f62f3\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nBecause of the Vagus Nerve\nYou can argue that emotions also tell the brain how to behave\nSo it’s not just a top down thing\nThere’s a bottom up component to it also\nSee also §"},"Notes/Ventilated-Double-Skin-Roof":{"title":"Ventilated Double Skin Roof","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ventilated Double Skin Roof §"},"Notes/Venturi-effect-in-architecture":{"title":"Venturi effect in architecture","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Keeping things cool with the Venturi effect §\nVenturi effect in architecture\nTo keep things cool\nIt’s not clear if it is applicable to small houses"},"Notes/Verbalizing-your-problems-is-very-powerful":{"title":"Verbalizing your problems is very powerful","links":["Notes/Accountability-is-key-to-good-habits"],"tags":["-on/accountability-buddies-partner-on/problem-sovling-learning--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nEllen Donnelly\nHow to get back up again after you fall in entrepreneurship\nurl: https://theask.substack.com/p/how-to-get-back-up-again-after-you\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nPerspective is also so powerful because the sheer act of verbalising something can relieve us of some of its pain.

It’s not oversharing, it’s not purging, it’s not indiscriminate disclosure, and it’s not social media information dumping. Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them. Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-building process.\n\n“Until we can receive with an open heart, we are never really giving with an open heart. When we attach judgment to receiving help, we knowingly or unknowingly attach judgment to giving help.” 3\n\nLearning how to lean into the discomfort of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure is a painful but rewarding process. So is saying “no” to your friends and acquaintances You may be terrified that you will piss off a friend or squander a professional opportunity. Try saying saying more often. You might find that you don’t regret it. Nothing may transform your life more than realizing that it’s a waste of time to evaluate your worthiness by weighing the reaction of the people in the stands.\nVulnerability is the bridge to authenticity / emotions / and connection. Vulnerability is strength. Vulnerability equals courage. \n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2014-12-13\ncreated:: 2014-12-13\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes §\n\n\nBrown, C. Brené.

Look at how the kids do it §\nWhen have you ever seen a child under the age of 10 pull or strain a muscle? Even if you give them something too heavy for them to pick up, they will try a few different methods and walk away without being hurt. Just like birds who are born instinctively knowing how to fly, children instinctively know how to move.\nWe can learn a lot by copying how children move! Plus it’s a lot of fun to rediscover some of these movements again in our adult lives.\nChildren are constantly exploring their environment and trying new things. They are not afraid of falling, because they know they will get back up again. And they move with a joy and exuberance that is hard to find in adults.\nWhen was the last time you moved your body just for the sake of moving? When was the last time you played?\nWe can all benefit from incorporating more movement and play into our lives. It doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming. Just a few minutes a day of moving our bodies in new and interesting ways can reinvigorate your routine and your movements!\nHere’s some fun movements that kids do all the time for you to try\nCrawling §\nOne great example of this is crawling.\nChildren are always moving on the ground, on the hands and knees. For us adults, most of the time we’re on our feet (or sitting on our butt). Try crawling again and see what it feels like.\nYou might be surprised at how good it feels to move your body in new ways. It can help increase your flexibility, balance, and coordination. And it’s a great way to relieve stress.\nSo next time you’re feeling stagnant in your movement, or like you need a break from the everyday grind, consider crawling around for a few minutes. It’s a great way to get your body moving and have some fun too!\nRolling §\nOne great example of this is rolling around. Like crawling, it’s another way that we can spend time on the floor and learn from being there. This one can be challenging, so go slow and do what makes you feel safe. Start by lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Place your arms at your sides. Slowly begin to roll your body to the right, using your lower back and glutes to control the movement. Return to the starting position and repeat on the left side. Continue alternating sides for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If this is too difficult, you can modify the move by keeping your knees bent and placing your hands on the floor beside you for support. Or, try placing a yoga block or pillow under your hips for additional support. Rolling is a great way to release tension in the spine and open up the chest and shoulders. It’s also a wonderful way to massage the internal organs and stimulate the lymphatic system. Give it a try and see how you feel!\nCrab walks §\nCrab walking is a great way to move your body in a new and interesting way. It’s also a great way to get a little bit of exercise in, as well as to have some fun.Crab walking is a movement that is often used in physical therapy, as it is a low-impact way to move the body and to get some exercise in. It is also a great way to improve balance and coordination. To do a crab walk, you will need to get down on all fours. You can either start in a standing position or a sitting position. If you start in a standing position, you will want to place your hands on your hips. If you start in a sitting position, you will want to place your hands on the ground in front of you. Once you are in position, you will want to slowly start to move your legs and arms. You will want to move them in a crab-like motion, moving them back and forth. You can also move your head from side to side if you want to. As you are crab walking, you will want to keep your back straight and your head up. You will also want to keep your core engaged so that you are stable. Once you have gotten the hang of crab walking, you can start to move faster and add in some turns. You can also add in some arm movements. Crab walking is a great way to get your body moving and to have some fun. It is also a great way to get some exercise in. Try it today!\nHopping and skipping §\nOne great example of this is hopping around and skipping. We never do this as adults! But kids are doing this all the time. It’s perfect for coordination. And it gives your muscles a little burst. Plus, it’s just plain fun! So next time you’re feeling stuck in a rut, take a cue from the kids and hop to it!\nIt’s about exploration, not perfection §\nWhen it comes to exploring and learning about their bodies, kids don’t strive for perfection or efficiency. Instead, they’re focused on understanding how things feel and what they can learn from the experience.\nThis mindset can be beneficial in many areas of life, not just when it comes to learning about the body. By taking the time to explore and understand how things feel, we can gain a greater understanding of the world around us and our place in it.\nWhen it comes to the body, this exploration can help you learn about the different sensations you feel and what you mean. It can also help them understand how their bodies work and how to take care of them.\nBy encouraging to explore and be aware of their bodies, we can help them develop a healthy relationship with their bodies and a better understanding of themselves.\nStart exploring, stop seeking perfection and optimization."},"Notes/War-and-Peace-and-War":{"title":"War and Peace and War","links":["Peter-Turchin","Notes/Asibaya-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"War and Peace and War §\nby Peter Turchin\nI love the idea of Asibaya (concept) in this book."},"Notes/Watching-play-dogs-play":{"title":"Watching play dogs play","links":["Notes/Animals-at-play-Twitter-Thread"],"tags":["-resilience-on/play-mutuality-dancing-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nJarlo Ilano\nBetter movement podcast\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62a314d73f707348d651930d\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nNuancing and taking things in the right context\nIt’s not always fighting\nIt’s not always easy\nThere has to be balance\nWatch 2 dogs play\nIt’s real but it’s play\nKeep the play going\nSee also §\nAnimals at play Twitter Thread"},"Notes/Water-Security-in-the-Philippines":{"title":"Water Security in the Philippines","links":[],"tags":["-water-on/environment-ecology-"],"content":"https://www.slideshare.net/EnPRageneAndreaPalma/water-quality-in-the-philippines-20082015\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Regional-setting-map-of-the-study-area-The-West-Luzon-Basin-is-located-between-the_fig1_226789997\nhttp://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/philippines/overview.htm"},"Notes/Waze-Seeking-Finding-your-way":{"title":"Waze Seeking Finding your way","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Waze and finding your way §\nI love using Waze.\nIf you’re somehow not familiar- Waze is a navigation app. It’s a GPS that will give you the best route when you’re going for a drive.\nThe reason I like it is because I don’t have to overthink.\nAnd it’s one less thing to worry about when I’m driving.\nI love letting go and just letting Waze tell me where to go and what to do.\nIt’s especially useful when I’m in a new place, and I’m trying to navigate new territory.\nIt will usually give me the best route.\nAnd help me know exactly where to go.\nAgain incredibly handy when in an unfamiliar place\nI remember when we were doing a roadtrip in Scotland\nand we were up in the highlands.\nWaze would be the one that would be the most reliable\nWaze is copying §\nThe trick with Waze is that you’re just copying.\nIt’s just emulation.\nYou don’t have to think.\nYou just do what you’re told.\nIn a sense, it’s like having a fitness coach\nSomeone who tells you exactly what to do.\nHow to do it\nAnd gives you feedback if you’re doing something wrong.\nWaze gives that kind of instant feedback too.\nWaze is always “recalculating” and trying to find a better route\nAnd if you make a wrong turn, waze also tries to help you get back on track.\nWhen Waze doesn’t work §\nBut over time, as you use waze,\nyou start to realize that it doesn’t always give the best results.\nIt’s good maybe 95% of the time\nBut sometimes, your own experience can kick in\nand tell you that this time, Waze isn’t exactly right\nPersonal Experience §\nYour familiarity with an area can outsmart waze\nI know this area near where I live.\nAnd the fastest route passes through the front of this huge factory\nand at 5pm it’s full of people getting of work.

Every note in a note library is a note. They come in two basic varieties:\n\nA note with mostly words\nA note with mostly links to other notes\n\nLet’s agree for the moment that a “note-with-mostly-words” is less complex than a “note-with-mostly-links”.\nA note with mostly links can therefore be considered a higher-order note. It is still a note, but all those links help to provide some sort of structure that adds complexity to the note itself.\nLet’s explore the wonderful world of higher-order notes.\nWhat can we call higher-order notes? §\nAdding a new word to our vocabulary opens up new ways of thinking and expressing. Limiting our vocabulary—like Big Brother does in George Orwell’s 1984—is a sinister way to limit our thinking.\nWith that in mind, instead of trying to limit what we can higher-order notes, we should explore the many flavors of them. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things we can call higher-order notes.\n\nLink Note - A note with a bunch of links.\nHub Note - A navigational note, like an airport hub (a Luhmann term).\nIndex Note - A note that references other notes (sometimes but not always alphabetical).\nWorkbench - A brainstorm-y note with a links hastily assembled.\nOutline Note - A note for the early-stage outlining of content.\nStructure Note - A term that describes what it does: structures stuff.\nStructure Zettel - A term from zettelkasten.de - Usually shown as a linear Table of Contents, often with annotations.\nTable of Contents - A finalized structure that references material\nMOC (Map of Content) - A flexible higher-order note that serves all the above purposes of gathering, outlining, structuring, and navigating. In addition, it is an active thinking tool that allows for the reshaping, connecting, and building of ideas.\n\nHere’s what else an MOC can do:\n\nMOCs can structure links in completely countless and non-linear ways.\nMOCs can be a combo of links and tags and text and embeds and anything you can think of.\nMOCs can be linked to other MOCs (Emergence Level 4), which eventually link to a Home note (Emergence Level 5).\nAnd most valuable, MOCs concentrate &amp; accelerate idea interaction.\n\n\nNow let’s answer the question: Why call higher-order notes MOCs?\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2020-06-28\ncreated:: 2020-06-28\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/What-are-the-benefits-of-generalization":{"title":"What are the benefits of generalization","links":["Range","David-J.-Epstein"],"tags":[],"content":"What are the benefits of being a generalist? §\nSource: §\n\nRange by David J.

This is because I want to know if my coach is Jarlo or Jim Jones. I want to know does this person have my best interest at the heart of any advice BEFORE I drink the kool-aide.\n//\nHow open they are to working with non-elite individuals, people who want to get better than where they are right now but who will never be objectively fast/strong/amazing/placing on podiums. Is that something they’re okay with - are they interested in helping people become better versions of themselves and make progress, or are they more interested in making “winners”/only having amazing success stories?\nHow realistic are they about their clients having lives outside training or competing priorities (job, illness, childcare, vacations, etc.), and how do they handle that? Encouragement and assistance in keeping the client moving forward through setbacks or challenges, or frustration and disappointment that the client isn’t “adhering to the scheduled program” and is “noncompliant”?\nHow do they handle conflict? What drives them as a coach, what’s their North Star?\n//\nI would want to know that a trainer would understand how to work with both physical and emotional/mental limitations, due to past injury, other loss of physical function, and with difficulties imagining the impossible becoming possible, as well as challenges staying consistent with training.  \nAlso someone who’s got a lot of ideas up their sleeve about how to tailor a movement to suit the person.\nSomeone who is good at listening, understanding, and being affirming of a trainee’s experience while encouraging them to move ahead and expand their capacity and physical autonomy.  And who can do all this with a sense of curiosity, experimentation, and fun.\n//\nNot really about a coach, but here’s how I chose my psychologist. I attended several conferences where she was one of the speakers, so I witnessed first hand both what she said about several subjects, and how she handled people who reacted both in positive and negative ways to what she was saying. Her practical, compassionate, yet no-nonsense approach won me over. It turned out to be a very good choice for me.\nI guess what I would like, if I were to get a personal coach, would be to be able to get to see them in action without the added pressure of a potential coaching relationship. Watching them teach and especially witnessing how they handle viewers’ questions would be helpful for me in deciding whether they might be a good fit for me or if instead their teaching style is not suitable for me.\nOn the practical side, I would also need to know whether they’re willing to do online sessions only or not, and what their hours of availability are: time zones are unfortunately a very real obstacle, and so are work schedules.\nSince losing the forums, my motivation has plummeted, so I really could use a coach to keep me accountable to myself, but I get discouraged very easily, so a simplified selection process would be awesome.\n//\nI want to know if they’ve injured themselves and how they came back from that. Feels like it’s an inevitability no matter the type of training you’re into. Yet, some of the trainers I see out there in the world act as though it’s never happened and or never will. I would want to check out reviews or even talk to past clients if that was available to me.\n//\nI have been with my current trainer for almost 3 years. Prior to her I had a trainer who started out ok but then became so fixated on his phone during our sessions. So for me, I look for attention to my issues/goals and focus during my hour session. I am lucky with my trainer who focuses on my posterior chain and strengths my running. For me pairing GMB and my trainer is the best of both worlds. I started off with her slouched and forward rolled shoulders where I would ask on am exercise and her response would be “no way, I would never have you do that. You do not have the mobility or control to properly perform that movement.”\nSince GMB we have delved into those exercises and she still ques me on position or corrects during. Oddly my trainer has a PhD in Anthropology with a focus on kinesiology and studies on human evolution. Her knowledge keeps me save, allows me to lift heavy, and her weekly workouts are like a box of chocolates…you never know what you will get.\n//\nI don’t know if there’s anything that they can really put out there in advance, because I think it’s a bit about personality fit. I like being around people with a sense of humour… but it would have to be my kind of humous XD so I guess as long as their website/social media showed that (there’s a reason I ended up here at Alpha).\nI’ve never really worked with a coach but I’ve had some pretty individual attention in yoga/pilates/ballet classes. What works for me might not work for everyone but I try to get a sense if they think there’s joy/fun to a workout, and if they’re generally positive and use lots of different kinds of cueing. I get frustrated when my physical limitations seem to be ignored (if it’s clear I’m pushing as hard as I can it doesn’t matter how many times you say “higher” my leg won’t go higher). \n//"},"Notes/What-are-you-willing-to-give-up-50-percent-of-your-net-worth-for":{"title":"What are you willing to give up 50% of your net worth for","links":["Notes/Deep-Why","Notes/Setting-motivation-For-lifelong-goals"],"tags":["-on/deep-why-motivation-on/purpose-on/value--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThe Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish\n#141 Kunal Shah: Core Human Motivations\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62d6857b4d60d5736f9c0cda\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nWhat would you give half of your net worth for\nThese are the core human motivations\nOr let me put it this way, let’s say I could really invent a pill that can make you younger Or healthier wouldn’t mean you give me 50% of your network.

It’s the “room where it happens.” Individual notes can “shadow-clone” themselves and essentially be in multiple parties simultaneous—interacting and developing complexity from each party at the same time!\nAnother way to consider MOCs is through “Idea Emergence”. MOCs are Evergreen Notes, just at the next level of emergence.\n\n\n\nAren’t MOCs just index notes?\n\nNo! MOCs are not static way-points. They are thinking, creating, and writing tools. We are not just map readers. We are the map makers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems to me creating MOCs creates more work, therefore distracts from note creation, writing and thinking. I cannot see the magic of it.\n\nMaking MOCs don’t distract from note creating and writing, they are note creating and writing.\nThat’s where the magic happens.\nWhat is the magic? It’s having a thinking tool that forces difficult conversations, that highlights holes in arguments, that shines a bright light on ideas that to be developed further.\nSee MOCs are Dialectics for more on this terribly awesome power.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you need a MOC to lead to other new notes? Isn’t that what Direct Links are all about? … In other words, what does an MOC achieve that Direct Links don’t?\n\nDirect Links are the strongest links. But many times we do not want a strong link. We want weaker links. Tags do this and so does naming notes starting with the topic, like: Mandarin - NOTE1, Mandarin - NOTE132.\nBut neither tags, nor alphabetical filenames, allow for a fluid conversation between notes to happen, where their relative positioning can change. MOCs allow for that.\nIn a sense, they allow for mini-folgezettels. It’s hard to get over how powerful of a thinking tool this is.\n\n\n"},"Notes/What-causes-stress":{"title":"What causes stress","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.precisionnutrition.com/what-causes-stress\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/What-do-you-do-when-you're-lost-q":{"title":"What do you do when you're lost?","links":["Notes/Show-up-fail-fast-and-learn"],"tags":["--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nPoetry Unbound\nDavid Wagoner — Lost\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/6333a77c45e03ac0fecb12e2\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nWhat do you do when you’re lost\nEven when you’re lost, there’s something to be found there\nSee also §\nShow up fail fast and learn"},"Notes/What-does-X-mean-in-metadata":{"title":"What does X mean in metadata","links":["Maps/Meta-PKM","tags/pkm"],"tags":["pkm"],"content":"up:: Meta PKM\ntags::#pkm\nWhat does X mean in metadata §\nAlthough “X” is not a word, it can quickly be intuited.\nX is a connection.

It’s true, our bodies are designed to be in motion. From the time we are born until the time we die, we are meant to be constantly moving and exploring our world.\nHowever, there are times in our lives when we can’t exercise anymore. Whether it’s due to an injury, a chronic illness, or just the simple fact that we are getting older, there are times when our bodies just can’t do what they used to.\nAnd that’s ok.\nJust because you can’t exercise doesn’t mean you have to give up on your health altogether. There are still plenty of things you can do to stay healthy, even if you can’t exercise.\nHere are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nEat healthy.\n\nJust because you can’t exercise doesn’t mean you have to eat junk food. In fact, eating healthy is even more important if you can’t exercise, because you need to make sure your body is getting the nutrients it needs to function properly.\n\nGet enough sleep.\n\nSleep is important for everyone, but it’s especially important if you can’t exercise. When you sleep, your body is able to rest and repair itself, so you need to make sure you’re getting enough sleep each night.\n\nStay hydrated.\n\nDrinking enough water is crucial for your health, regardless of whether or not you can exercise. When you’re not exercising, you’re still losing water through sweat and urine, so you need to make sure you’re replenishing your body’s supply.\n\nTake breaks.\n\nEven if you can’t exercise, you can still stay active by taking breaks throughout the day. Get up and walk around every few hours, or do some light stretching.\n\nFind an activity you enjoy.\n\nJust because you can’t exercise doesn’t mean you can’t be active. There are plenty of other activities you can do that don’t involve exercise, such as hiking, swimming, or even just walking your dog.\n\nConnect with others.\n\nStaying connected with other people is important for your mental health. Whether you join a support group, connect with friends online, or just talk to your family, social interaction is crucial for your well-being.\nIf you can’t exercise, don’t despair. There are still plenty of things you can do to stay healthy and happy. Just focus on taking care of yourself, and the rest will fall into place.\nIt’s important to remember that even if you can’t exercise, you can still take steps to stay healthy. There are plenty of options for staying active and keeping your body healthy, even if you can’t do traditional exercises. Don’t give up on your health just because you can’t exercise!"},"Notes/What-to-do-if-you're-afraid-to-exercise-again":{"title":"What to do if you're afraid to exercise again","links":["Maps/Health-MOC","tags/output/linkedin","tags/perfectionism","tags/fear","tags/trust"],"tags":["output/linkedin","perfectionism","fear","trust"],"content":"up:: Health MOC\ntags::\nrank::\nOutputs:\n- output::#output/linkedin Javier Luis Gomez on LinkedIn:#perfectionism#fear#trust\n**\n“I’d love to exercise again, but I’m afraid I’ll do it wrong”\nDoes this sound like you?\nOne deep breath, here’s what you need to remember:\n1️⃣ You don’t need to be perfect to reap the benefits of exercise\nThe big killer of routines is #perfectionism.\nIf you try to be all-or-nothing, 95% percent of the time, you just end up doing nothing.\nSo you missed a day?\nThat’s fine!

And it made me think about how I used to feel the same way. I was injured a lot when I was younger and it always seemed to happen at the worst possible times. I would be in the middle of a race or training for a big event and I would get injured.\nIt was always so frustrating because I knew I was capable of so much more. But the fear of getting injured again was always holding me back.\nI’m not sure what changed for me, but at some point, I decided that I was going to start moving again. And I was going to do it injury-free.\nIf you want to overcome your fear here a few things to try §\n\nAvoid overprotecting your body\n\nWe often think that if we wrap ourselves in bubble wrap and never put ourselves in harm’s way, we’ll be safe from injury.\nBut the truth is, this isn’t really living. And, it’s not an effective way to prevent injuries. Instead, we need to find a balance between protecting our bodies and exposing them to some risk. This means accepting that there is a certain amount of risk involved in everything we do, and learning to live with that.\nOf course, this doesn’t mean we should be reckless and throw caution to the wind. But it does mean we need to be more mindful of the risks we’re taking, and make sure we’re prepared for them.\n\nGet out of fear reinforcing places, like the internet\n\nIf you’re like most people, the thought of getting injured can be a bit scary. And if you’re someone who’s constantly looking for information on the internet about how to avoid getting injured, you might be inadvertently reinforcing your fear.\nHere’s the thing: when it comes to injury, there’s no such thing as a completely safe place. Sure, you can take all the precautions in the world, but at the end of the day, there’s always a chance that something could happen.\nSo, if you’re looking to overcome your fear of injury, one of the best things you can do is to get out of fear-reinforcing places like the internet. Instead, focus on enjoying your life and living in the moment.\nSure, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved in whatever you’re doing. But if you’re constantly living in fear of getting injured, you’re not going to enjoy your life very much.\nSo, next time you’re feeling scared about the possibility of getting injured, take a step back and remember that life is meant to be enjoyed, not feared.\n\nFind people who support your return to play and activity\n\nIt’s been almost a year since I suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined me from my favorite sports and activities. The recovery process has been long and difficult, and there have been times when I thought I would never be able to return to the level of activity I was once able to enjoy.\nThankfully, I have had the support of family and friends throughout my recovery, and their encouragement has been instrumental in helping me get back to where I am today. If you’re currently dealing with the fear of injury and are unsure about returning to your previous level of activity, I urge you to find people who will support your decision and help you along the way.\nThe road to recovery can be a long and difficult one, but it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. There are others who have been through similar experiences and who understand what you’re going through. These people can offer valuable advice and support, and they can help you overcome your fears.\nIf you’re ready to take the next step, find people who will support your return to play and activity. With their help, you can get back to doing the things you love, injury-free.\n\nAccept that injury is possible, but discover what is worth it\n\nInjuries are an unfortunate and, at times, unavoidable part of life. While we all hope to avoid them, the reality is that they can happen to anyone, at any time. And, while some injuries are more serious than others, even the most minor ones can cause a great deal of fear and anxiety.\nIf you’re someone who lives in fear of being injured, it’s important to understand that your fear is valid. Injuries can be incredibly painful and can have a long-lasting impact on your life. However, it’s important to remember that injuries are also a part of life. They’re something that happen to everyone, and they’re not always avoidable.\nThe key to overcoming your fear of injury is to accept that they’re a possibility, but to also discover what is worth it. For example, if you’re afraid of being injured while playing sports, ask yourself if the joy and satisfaction you get from playing is worth the risk of injury. In most cases, the answer will be yes.\nRemember, injuries are a part of life. They’re not something to be feared, but something to be accepted. And, while they can be difficult to deal with, they’re also a reminder of what’s truly important in life.\n\nMove for enjoyment as much as possible\n\nWe all know the feeling: that dread in the back of your mind that injury will happen if you push your body too hard. It’s a common fear, especially when it comes to physical activity. But the good news is, you can overcome this fear by moving for enjoyment as much as possible.\nExercise should be something that you look forward to, not something that you dread. And the best way to make sure that it is something you enjoy is to find an activity that you love. It doesn’t have to be a high-intensity workout; it can be something as simple as going for a walk or a bike ride.\nThe key is to find an activity that you can do consistently, and that you can do for an extended period of time. This will help your body to adapt and become stronger, which will in turn help to reduce the fear of injury.\nSo, if you’re looking to overcome the fear of injury, move for enjoyment as much as possible. Find an activity that you love, and make it a part of your regular routine. Your mind and body will thank you for it.\nIt’s impossible to 100% avoid injury- that’s simply a fact. §\nI’m not saying that I never get injured anymore. I’m just saying that I’m no longer afraid of it.\nIf you’re someone who is afraid of getting injured, I encourage you to start moving again. Start slow and listen to your body. You might be surprised at what you’re capable of."},"Notes/What-to-do-if-your-inner-voice-is-cruel":{"title":"What to do if your inner voice is cruel","links":["Maps/Psychology-MOC","Notes/Creative-problem-solving-means-suspending-judgement"],"tags":["-judge-","-critic-","-saboteur-","-thinking"],"content":"Why are we so self critical?\nI actually wrote about this in a newsletter [Becoming Fitforlife #35]\nOur inner voices can be incredible problem-solvers or harsh critics.\nTo make our inner voices less cruel, we need to cultivate our self-compassion.

It does not apply to more fluid structures. Let’s explore…\nArgument 1\nCreating categories is a top-down process. You start with the structure and then file the material away. Notes will have to fit the structure. If they don’t, there’ll have to be a compromise. 1\nCounter\nIf a categorizing framework is set up to be fluid, it is not top down. Notes do not have to fit its structure. There is no compromise. In the case of a Home note, it’s a pre-existing structure that you can tether to only when you care to. It adds context without limiting access.\nHere is that same picture: Wolverine is the note, and your Home note is just another tether:\n\nArgument 2\nStatic categories are rigid. Our brains are not rigid. Therefore static categories inhibit our knowledge from growing organically.\nCounter\nThis is still assuming that “categories equal top-down oppressive hierarchies.”But with Maps of Content (MOCs), it’s quite the opposite. MOCs spring up organically as the need arises for them. An example is this kit’s note called: LYT Kit; I didn’t start with that; I instinctually grasped for it once I felt I had too many notes everywhere.\nArgument 3\nI don’t have categories and I’m doing fine.\nCounter\nDo you have more than 300 notes or so? You have categories. You just aren’t calling them that.\n\nTags are a form of category, they are fluid. They don’t scale well as your note collection grows though. 2\nStarred notes are another form of mostly fluid structuring.\nDo you have “daily notes” or timestamped notes? Certainly seems like a category to me; and a rigid one at that! 3\nIf you only have notes that are directly linked to other notes—and nothing else—then you can truly say you have no categories. The price for no categorization is steep.\n\nPlease read about the framework most likely to produce a paradigm shift in your knowledge management game: MOCs Overview.\n\nFootnotes §\n\n\nSource: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/ From one of the leading minds, Christian is a voice I cherish and he has greatly influenced the broader zettelkasten community. ↩\n\n\nBut if you have Boolean searches to your notes, it mostly can mitigate the scaling problem—then you’d just have to remember the correct tags, which in practice isn’t a certainty. ↩\n\n\nEven though it’s a more rigid category, I just can’t give up on the multi-pronged power of the Temporal Context. Give up chronologically-date notes at your own discretion. Your future self may be disappointed. ↩\n\n\n"},"Notes/Why-Do-We-Put-Off-Exercise-When-We-Know-It’ll-Make-Us-Feel-Better-q":{"title":"Why Do We Put Off Exercise When We Know It’ll Make Us Feel Better?","links":["Notes/Focusing-on-Meaningful-Movement","Exercises-MOC","Notes/Play-is-a-state-of-Mind"],"tags":["--"],"content":"Usually, when I’m sitting still for too long, I start to become more and more antsy.

Here is an attempt to capture\na tiny example of how ideas emerge…\nI recently re-stumbled across a term called “Intertextuality”. Intertextuality describes how past things are referenced in new things.\nIt is related to “Idea Emergence”. Idea Emergence describes how that referencing system actually works.\nThe Wikipedia article for Intertextuality mentioned James Joyce’s novel Ulysses as an example. I read some of the article. Then I did nothing. No notes. No highlights. No comments.\nBut that’s okay, because seeds were planted that would lead to a simple and unexpected emergence.\nThe next day, I was writing a newsletter.\nI wanted to make point about Idea Emergence. I wanted to say that our past experiences affect our future ideas in unpredictable ways.\nI started typing “Without past inspirations…”\nThat triggered my brain to fire up and I was reminded of a familiar quote:\n\nWithout Ithaca, there would be no Odyssey.\n\nAnd that led to my emergent breakthrough. I merged the following:\n\nThe quote structure (“without BLANK, there would be no BLANK”)\nThe quote topic (The Odyssey)\nAnother topic I recently encountered (Intertextuality, Joyce, and Ulysses)\n\ninto this breakthrough:\n\nWithout the Odyssey, there is no Ulysses.\n\nPretty cool, right! (At least I was excited about it.)\nThat’s my attempt to capture a tiny example of how Idea Emergence works in powerful ways. And we can create the conditions around us to make these emergent moments happen more reliably.\nHow?\nBy linking things together. Something I call “linking your thinking”.\nLinking your thinking sets up the conditions for you to consistently experience the wondrous creative power and joy of Idea Emergence.\nHow can you start?\nStop messing around with shiny distractions. Start making notes and linking notes. Don’t get caught up over-analyzing. Don’t try to create the perfect system. Just make notes and link those notes to other notes.\nAll the other stuff isn’t going to matter if you don’t do the fundamentals.\nWithout the fundamentals, there is no flow.\nWithout the basics, there is no breakthrough.\n(You try one!)\nWithout BLANK, there is no BLANK.\nEmail me with yours (or tweet me at @nickmilo)!\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2022-06-26\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Witness-Consciousness":{"title":"Witness Consciousness","links":["Notes/Scott-Fitzgerald-Quote"],"tags":[],"content":"Witness Conscioiusness §\nLearning to witness your own mind\nThis comes from Jonathan Blow’s game The Witness\nBut I suppose it has connections to eastern philosophy and zen buddhism\nThe ability to see yourself\nin a witness\nin a non biased kind of way.\nMindfulness §\nOf course it links to mindfulness\nOf course it links to being non judgemental\nIs this in Christianity? §\nI think so?\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that this is how God looks at us\nBut it takes a while to realize that\nBecause we project our own self hatred and judgement onto the way God looks at us.\nChristianity doesn’t do this well §\nBecause there’s so much moralizing\nand so much focus on orthodoxy\nEastern Religions §\nBut in the eastern religions, it seems more like people are open minded\nor it’s okay for things to just be as they are.\nThey don’t have to be a certain way.\nWhat is this usually the place where it happens?\nI wonder what the texts are?\nThe documents?\nWhere do these ideas come from?\nI actually don’t know too much.\nIt would be great to look into this a bit more.\nThe east gets something that the west does not\nThere is some fundamental failure in the way western civ does this\nit’s too enlightment\nit’s too dualistic.\nI wonder how eastern civilizations get around this.\nIt’s the zen kohans.\nThe ability to hold paradox\nScott Fitzgerald Quote\nIt’s really that the west has to relearn this.\nBecause the east already gets this well\nParadoxes of Christianity §\nI guess Christianity tried to do this with the mysteries of faith\nbut somehow it become basta na lang.\nBahala na.\nNo need to think about it too much\nJust accept instead of struggle\nThe struggle is the middle ground\nIt’s not either you accept\nor you reject.\nYou struggle"},"Notes/Wokeness-and-the-Radical-Left":{"title":"Wokeness and the Radical Left","links":["Notes/Not-everything-needs-a-moral"],"tags":["-wokeness-radical-left-society--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nvitalik.ca\nWhat Do I Think About Network States?\nurl: https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/07/13/networkstates.html\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThe problem with wokeness and radical left\nIf you believe that “wokeness” is an important movement that protects the vulnerable, you may not appreciate the almost off-handed dismissal that it is basically just a mask for a professional elite’s will-to-power (View Highlight)\nSee also §\nNot everything needs a moral"},"Notes/Women-Gathering-Mushrooms":{"title":"Women Gathering Mushrooms","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Women gathering mushrooms §\nIs a song\nThat’s hard to follow\nRepresents the mushroom\nhttps://digitalcollections.wesleyan.edu/object/wupmusic-78"},"Notes/Wood-Finish-Finder-Tool":{"title":"Wood Finish Finder Tool","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Wood Finish Finder Tool §\nhttps://www.ragnbonebrown.com/content/wood-finish-finder-tool"},"Notes/Words-I've-used-to-describe-important-habits":{"title":"Words I've used to describe important habits","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","tags/on/pd","Power-Actions"],"tags":["habit","on/pd"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit,#on/pd\nWords I’ve used to describe important habits §\nFor some reason I’ve called important habits a lot of different things over the years.

Basically ask yourself: “What actions and tasks would make today feel like a worthwhile day? How much is realistic? In what order should I do them?”\nType or write them down. Keep track of them during the day. Adjust as needed. Writing down your daily goals combats those random attentional detours so you can stay on the main road.\nIf you write out your daily goals, you naturally visualize them and prioritize them in the mind, you have a touchstone with which to check your progress throughout the day. It adds security.\nIt also tracks easily forgotten “wins” to provide a small sense of accomplishment. See Small Wins foster a Sense of Control. There are many days when it feels like you got nothing done. By tracking your daily goals, you save yourself from that false feeling of “never enough” and internalize how much you actually did accomplish. It’s a pleasant surprise and completely valid—the daily goals just keeps it in the proper perspective.\nConclusion\nThe Morning Journal and Daily Goals are the 1-2 punch to creating momentum and maintaining it throughout the day.

Alan Watts called wu wei “not forcing”.\nThis reminds me of Flow, the wonderful concept by Mihaly C.\nIt’s similar to Flow in that action becomes effortless, but it’s different in that…hmm, I see a venn diagram and there is much more overlapping than is not. I would say that Flow may inherently have more intention behind it, but the funny thing is that those intentions melt away once the state of Flow is achieved.\nI’ve experienced Wu wei in my life when I’ve chosen not to immediately act on something. (ADD EXAMPLE LATER) In that way, it would seem there are some overlaps between Wu wei and Stoicism. EXPLORE LATER\n\nWu-wei is good because, if I were to view it through a Western lens, it has positive implications for stress management. Attempting to practice Wu-wei (as far as one can practice it without deliberately practicing it!), will help a person focus less on their “Circle of Concern” and more on their “Circle of Influence”. Basically, practicing wu-wei can help us stop worrying about the things we can’t control.\n\nWiki §\n\nWu wei (Chinese: 無為; pinyin: wúwéi) is an ancient Chinese concept literally meaning “inexertion”, “inaction”, or “effortless action”. Wu wei emerged in the Spring and Autumn period, and from Confucianism, to become an important concept in Chinese statecraft and Taoism, and was most commonly used to refer to an ideal form of government, including the behavior of the emperor.  Describing a state of unconflicting personal harmony, free-flowing spontaneity and savoir-faire, it generally also more properly denotes a state of spirit or mind, and in Confucianism accords with conventional morality.  Sinologist Jean François Billeter describes it as a “state of perfect knowledge of the reality of the situation, perfect efficaciousness and the realization of a perfect economy of energy”, which in practice Edward Slingerland qualifies as a “set of (‘transformed’) dispositions (including physical bearing)… conforming with the normative order”.\nWikipedia\n"},"Notes/Yannick's-Twitter-Tricks":{"title":"Yannick's Twitter Tricks","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases."},"Notes/Yin-and-Yang":{"title":"Yin and Yang","links":["Maps/Concepts-MOC","tags/concept","tags/note/develop","Notes/Seasons"],"tags":["concept","note/develop"],"content":"up:: Concepts MOC\ntags::#concept,#note/develop🍃\nYin and Yang §\nWiki §\nIn Chinese philosophy, yin and yang is a concept of dualism in ancient Chinese philosophy, describing how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.\nThe Seasons are related to Yin and Yang."},"Notes/You-2.0--Breaking-Free-From-Existential-Inertia":{"title":"You 2.0- Breaking Free From Existential Inertia","links":["Maps/Psychology-MOC","Notes/Habits-are-all-about-identity-change"],"tags":["inertia","stuckness","psychology","boredom"],"content":"Life is a journey, but sometimes it feels like a traffic jam.

But I’ve had little success since I started.\nMy problem: There are so many health coaches and I was struggling to set myself apart.\nEveryone says you need to find your niche, and I’ve been trying to do that online for a while. I was writing, posting on Twitter, building in public and trying to see what people were resonating with. But something still wasn’t clicking and I wasn’t sure what it was.\nThen I started working with Shruthi\nToday, I am clear about my niche and who I want to serve. My name is Javier and I help people stuck in a physical injury build up mental fitness to trust their body again.\nJust saying that gives me goosebumps because it fits so much with who I am as a person. I truly want to help people stuck in injury to enjoy their lives again.\nWhat was the one thing that helped you get insane clarity and propel your business forward?\nWorking with Shruthi is both fun and challenging. She is supportive and at the same time clear on what steps I need to take for growth.\nI got the most value when we did an exercise on thinking about my ideal customer. I’m done many customer avatar exercises before, but I was still afraid to narrow it down.\n“What if it’s too narrow?”\n“What if I’m limiting myself?”\n“What if there are people outside of my niche I want to help?”\nAll those questions were strong in my mind.\nShruthi helped me accept that it’s not just about me, it’s also about who I want to help. Who are the VERY specific people that I have the skills to help? Can I focus all my energy on finding and helping those people = aka my niche\nHow clear are your next steps of action after the coaching?\nNow that I know I’m focusing on people who need mental fitness to trust their body, I’m more propelled to write, research, and reach out.\nBack then, when I called myself a health coach, it was hard to find who I was talking to. Because everyone needs a health coach in some way. As I said, I couldn’t set myself apart.\nNow, when I see someone I can help, I want to go out of my way to offer them resources and support.\nIt’s simple, but it’s not easy- and this is the stage I’m practicing now.
