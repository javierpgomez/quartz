But getting there isn’t so simple.\nMaxim 1 is reminds us: “The goals don’t come from the coach, they come from the client.” As a coach, my goal is to listen to you, understand what your goal is, and then offer my experience to help you do what you already want to do.\nHighlight the desire that they already have.\nMaxim 2: Help them feel successful §\nThe trick to long term change is to string together small successes.\nYou might feel like this is cheating- and that you shouldn’t celebrate until you hit you big goal at the end. But the opposite is true. Our brain loves feeling like it’s winning. And by giving it small wins, it’s willing to do more of that. Make your clients feel like they’re already succeeding- in small ways.

They affect each other.\nPick the one you’d like to work on and leverage that to build the other two.\n—\n#1 Practice good sleep habits\nFor some stupid reason, I still hear people brag about how little sleep they get away with. STOP\nSleep is THE NUMBER ONE thing you can do for your health. It can:\n\nReduce stress\nMore energy\nBetter focus\nThis list could just goes on\n\n—\nWhen you get good sleep, you’ll have more energy to move. If your sleep habits are consistent, the body can regulate your appetite better.\nYour health flywheel starts spinning\n—\n#2 Nutrition: Let the good food crowd out the junk\nThe number 1 reason diets fail is by trying to be too good too fast.\nThat’s like trying to stop a train moving at full speed.\nInstead, don’t cut out the junk yet. Start by introducing good food instead.\n\nAdd veggies\nGo for less processed food\nTry leaner meats\n\nTrust that over time, you’ll appreciate good foods too- then you can try and cut back on the junk.\n—\nAs you eat well, you’ll start to fuel your body properly. Movement will be easier with that fuel. And cutting back the junk helps you sleep better.\nYour health flywheel starts spinning\n—\n#3 Movement: Stop ‘exercising’- keep moving instead\nModern life has squished all our movement into 1 hour of exercise\n\nGym sessions\nMovement classes\nCardio time\n\nThis forgets that our bodies are designed to be constantly on the move.\n—\nReframe: How can you ‘exercise’ less, but move all day instead?\n\nTake a walk and catch up with a friend?\nBike to and from work?\nHave more physical hobbies- like woodworking or gardening?\n\n—\nAs you start to move more, your body will be tired and ready sleep each night. You’ll also start looking for the food you need to refuel yourself well.\nYour health flywheel starts spinning\n—\nTLDR: How to get your health flywheel spinning\n\nDevelop a steady sleep routine\nLet good foods crowd out junk\nStop exercising and start moving\n\nOnce your health flywheel, you’ll discover there are tricks within each one.

Sleep is the miracle drug that no one really takes. There are so many benefits to getting good sleep. But we still treat sleep deprivation like it’s some kind of superpower.\nIn reality, being able to sleep well and accept sleep is better.\n—\nFind ways to move, and not just exercise.\nA culture of exercising takes away from the fact that we just need to be moving all the time.

And those early ones count the most!\nGive yourself a low minimum, the rest is gravy §\nBecause those early steps count the most- the benefit is biggest at the start. Get those early steps in by setting a generously low minimum for yourself. Make it easy to get out the door.\nThe trap of 10,000 steps is that we believe the benefits are at the end.

And as much as I would love to have time to go on long runs or hit up the gym, I just can’t. So I’m practicing establishing a minimum workout. And then not feeling so guilty when I have to resort to that.\n2. Sneak in more activity §\nAnother trick I like is finding ways to get a little bit more physical activity throughout the day. Standing desk is the classic example of this. My personal fave is using a basket instead of a cart when grocery shopping. (I gotta carry it around + I end up buying less).\n3. Stop Comparing Myself to Myself §\nMaybe the hardest one for me, but I find I’m always thinking back to how fit I used to be back then.

Almost always something was a bit off- and I would find different ways to fix it.\nI didn’t have to wonder if I did a good or bad job- the results were clear to see.\nFind a real activity with real results §\nLike woodworking, there are many activities that scratch this itch. \nAnd we’re starting to understand all the benefits of these activities.\n\nToday, more and more of our work is conceptual- and very subjective.\nCoaching can be one of them. It’s hard to tell if I’m doing it well. Same thing with being a team manager, or a corporate CEO. When things don’t work- you can talk your way out of it and explain what went wrong.\nBut real activities with real results give it to us clear.\nReal Activities help us feel grounded, calm, and can help reduce pain §\nAll sorts of activities count here- even things like knitting and crafting.\nIn his newsletter on movement, Todd Hargrove talks about how many people who have these kinds of hobbies find themselves in a ‘flow state.’ It’s that feeling when the world just slips away, time slows down and you can fully immerse yourself in what you’re doing.\nReal activities can get us into the flow state consistently.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111281849--Placebo-Notes":{"title":"202111281849- Placebo Notes","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202111281849- Placebo Notes\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nGoing down a Placebo rabbit hole §\nThe human body is weird.\nI encountered an article this week about how just thinking you got a good night’s sleep actually improves your cognitive performance. I’m very careful around the claim that “your perception is your reality,” but I also have to admit that our minds are really powerful when it comes to influencing how we act in the world.\nWhat is placebo sleep and what should I do about it? §\nIt seems that the idea of placebo sleep is rooted in this one study from 2014. As far as I can tell, it’s the only major study on the topic.\n\nIn the study,\n(1) they asked participants to rate how they slept the night before\n(2) gave them a quick 5-minute lesson on sleep and REM cycles\nthen the placebo part:\n(3) Hooked them up to machine (that does nothing), “measured” their sleep, and then told them their previous night’s rest was just what they needed\nIn the experiment, the belief that you got enough sleep was enough to boost cognitive performance as if you had actually slept well the night before.\nMy 2 big takeaways from the study §\n#1 Education about how the body works plays a big part in health.\nThe days when coaches and doctors could just talk down to their patients are gone.\nI learned this firsthand when I was experiencing chronic pain. The first step on my path to recovery was educating myself on how pain works (4min). Through that I became less anxious and fearful, and I could take care of my health better\nWhen it comes to health- teaching someone how their body works is important. And communicating it well is a skill that coaches need to learn.\n#2 Relying on ‘objective’ trackers can backfire. There’s merit to subjective measurement\nIn the past, I was obsessed with tracking my sleep data on my smartwatch.\nSome days, I would wake up feeling good, but my watch would tell me that I didn’t sleep enough. Then everything would backfire. I would get anxious. I would second guess my sleep. I would worry about making it up the next night.\nBy focusing on your overall sleep experience (1min) and not just the data, you can improve the quality of your sleep and feel more rested when you get up in the mornin\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111281850--Health-and-Wealth":{"title":"202111281850- Health and Wealth","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202111281850- Health and Wealth\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThe common factor between growing wealth and practicing health §\nThis week is one my own writing.\nSomeone shared with me a podcast with Morgan Housel, the author of The Psychology of Money. I couldn’t help but see the parallels between building health and developing the mindset for lifelong health.\nI wrote this Twitter post on how this applies to ex-athletes. And the response was very positive from a lot of other people too.\nSo here’s a more generalized version of the ideas I wrote about.\n#1 We overlook the benefits of the compounding effect §\nThe classic story here is the one of the chessboard and the doubling grain of rice. I’ve heard this many times. I studied Mathematics in college. I know it’s true, and it still feels counterintuitive. \nI think the paradigm shift here is not thinking of it in terms of losses or gains, but in terms of making your base bigger. If you make your goal a 1% increase, that feels like very little. (see also: James Clear on 1% better). But the trick is in how much you start with.\nIf you start at 10, 1% of that is 1,\nbut 1% of 100 is 10,\n1% of 1000 is 100…\nYou get the idea.\nIf you’re starting out at 1, that’s great. Gain 1% slowly and steadily, and before you know it, you’re working with such a big base that health growth becomes easier and steadier.\n#2 We compare ourselves to others too much §\nI’m guilty of this myself.\nAs an ex-athlete, I’m always trying to compete with other people. We see other people who look further along than us, and it feels discouraging. We don’t even want to start our own journeys.\nMorgan Housel writes about Internal and External Benchmarks. \nIf you’re measuring yourself against other people (External Benchmarks) you’ll always find someone who seems more healthier, stronger, and further along their health journey.\nInstead focus on Internal Benchmarks. Understand what your values are, and what makes you happy. That can be the measure of your progress\n#3 Avoid extremes and seek balance §\nIn order the get the benefits of the compounding effect, you have to be consistent.\nWe have this tendency to be all or nothing. We set big goals, push hard for a while and then stop abandon them when things get hard.\nInstead, plan around the highs and lows. When things are good, take advantage, and brace yourself for challenging times. When things are challenging, do the minimums, get through, and be ready for when things lighten up.\nThe trick is to be consistent, and never hit pause on your practices.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111281948--Dunning-Kruger":{"title":"202111281948- Dunning Kruger","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/on/knowledge","tags/learning","tags/imposter-syndrome"],"tags":["permanent-note","on/knowledge","learning","imposter-syndrome"],"content":"topic: 202111281948- Dunning Kruger\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#on/knowledge#learning#imposter-syndrome §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThe more I know, the more I feel like I don’t know §\nI didn’t study biomechanics, or sports science, or physical therapy. I don’t actually have any degrees that apply to coaching fitness.\nI’m constantly hounded by this feeling that I’m not ‘qualified enough’ to be a coach- and that I’m just faking it.

Most people have this idea that being fit means looking good, and moving well. And while those are nice things to have, it’s better to root your practice in things that might matter more to you.\nWhat would being fit mean for you? \nIt could be:\n\nI’ll be strong enough to travel, enjoy my hobbies\nI have the energy work and be creative\nI can play with my kids (and grandkids)\n\nThese kinds of things are what really motivate us to exercise.

He’s a coach who is obsessed with the words we use when teaching movement.\nHis main idea is that the words that we use matter. It has a measurable effect on our performance. This is most useful for coaches. But even if you’re a regular person trying to move better, there are a few takeaways to help you here.\nHere are some quick principles from my first jump in.\n\n1. Use an external cue §\nInstead of saying “lift your arms more” (internal cue), try saying instead “push towards the ceiling.” (external cue) The reason this works is that with an internal cue you zone in on one body part, and the body as a whole coordinates less. But with an external cue, your whole body focuses on that goal, and the body coordinates better.\n2. Use metaphors and images §\nApart from external cues, using images and metaphors also helps the body coordinate. Try using different images when you’re doing movements.\n\n“Take of like a plane” when you’re sprinting\n“Bounce like a gazelle” when jumping\n“Sit back into a chair” when doing a squat\n\nHear Nick Winkelman talk about it here\n3. Get into Trial and Error §\nBecause we’re using metaphors and images, there’s a bit of trial and error involved. We have different images in our head. Some metaphors might work better for you than others. It becomes more of an art than a science at this point. Trying different things and experimenting is the name of the game.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111290749--Movement-over-exercise":{"title":"202111290749- Movement over exercise","links":["Notes/202201252136--Health,-Culture,-and-National-security","Automation-is-coming--here's-what-that-means-for-movement"],"tags":["-movement-exercise-on/technology-"],"content":"My writing (250-300 words) §\nThe one reason you should stop exercising and start moving\n—\nTechnology doesn’t save time, it actually saves movement\nPeople think of technology as gadgets and devices that make life more convenient.

But we think convenient means more productive.

But now, there are machines can do that also. Look at every machine in your life- and see how it’s outsourcing movement in some way. The telelphone is outsourcing the walk to the neighbors.

But if you zoom out, and view your goals from a big picture, you can see how your goals connect to one another.\nImagine 3 levels of Goals: The Super-goal, the Intermediate-Goal, the Sub-Goal §\nOur goals fall into one of these 3:\n\nIf the super goal is “I want to be healthy”\nThe intermediate goals are “To be physically strong,” “To avoid stress,” and “To eat well”\nThen sub-goals are “Exercise 15 minutes a day,” “Eat a handful of greens at dinner,” AKA your smart goals\n\nSee how your goals connect and expect it to be non-linear! §\nThat’s because a sub-goal can link to more than 1 intermediate goal. And an intermediate goal can link to more than 1 super goal.\nBecause health is interconnected, you can expect one practice to benefit the others also. It’s not a simple IF-THIS-THEN-THAT. You can experience benefits in many areas at once with health practices.\nAnd it helps to see it all laid out.\nSeeing the network shows you different paths to work on your health §\nWith your Goal Network, even when motivation is low, you can stay on track.\nBecause many Sub-Goals can get you to your Super-Goal.

So if this sounds like something you’d like to work toward, participate in a cohort of Ship 30 for 30 to start creating your library of content online and gathering data/analytics on “what’s working.” Alumni are then invited to join The Captain’s Table after they’ve completed at least one cohort of Ship 30 for 30.\nBut until then, we wanted to give you a framework for turning FREE readers into PAID customers.\nAnd the framework goes like this…\nDigital Writing Fast-Track Framework Of The Week: §\nIn order for readers to feel like you are someone worth investing their time, attention, and money into, they need a few questions answered.\nSpecifically, they need 8 questions answered.\nAnd if you can deliver on these 8 questions (in your free content, in the introduction of your book/course, on your landing page, etc.), the likelihood they want to keep investing more in their relationship with you and your content goes up exponentially.\nHere’s the roadmap:\nQuestion #1: Who Are YOU? §\nIf you say, “Hey you,” the reader doesn’t know if you’re talking to them or not.\nAnd if you say, “Hey, mom,” the reader sort of assumes you’re talking to them but they also aren’t quite sure.\nBut if you say, “Hey single-mom struggling to maintain her sanity while raising 2 kids, and dad is at work all day, and you’re stressed about the bills, and you haven’t had a healthy meal in who-knows-how-long,” WOW, that very specific audience knows you’re talking to her and only her.\nAnd that’s the goal.\nThe more specific you can be about who your WHO is, the more likely your target WHO will trust you (because they feel seen, heard, and understood).\nState your WHO.\nQuestion #2: Where is your target reader stuck in Struggle City? §\nImagine your target reader is stuck.\nStuck in Struggle City.\nThey are experiencing 5 huge problems. What are they? Do you know? Can you list them out? How specific can you get?\nAnd what are the causes of these problems? Where do they come from? How does your target reader feel about them? What’s the urgency? How badly do they wish these problems were gone? (If the problems aren’t very urgent or important, then you aren’t talking about the right problems!)\nList the 5 biggest problems your target reader faces today.\nQuestion #3: Who can they blame? §\nThis is sales copywriting 101.\nNever make the customer blame themselves. (When was the last time someone pointed out a problem in your life, where you were the main culprit, and you didn’t get defensive?)\nInstead, give the customer someone/something else to blame.\n\nCan they blame their teachers? Maybe they weren’t given the right information.\nCan they blame their surroundings? Maybe they aren’t in a supportive environment.\nCan they blame their prior purchases? Maybe those promised things but didn’t deliver.\n\nThe point is: the customer needs to feel the urgency to change without feeling bad about themselves and their lack of progress to-date. (This is their “golden bridge” they can retreat on to leave Struggle City for good.)\nGive them something to blame.\nQuestion #4: What are the myths holding them back from making progress? §\nThe reader is ready to change.\nBut they probably have a bunch of “myths” swirling around in their heads helping them rationalize staying stuck in Struggle City.\n\nWhat advice do “most people” give them, and why is it wrong?\nWhat stats do “most people” not know, and how can you educate them?\nWhat beliefs do “most people” internalize, that are doing them a disservice?\n\nThe more you can pull back the curtain and give readers “an insider’s take” on what’s really going on, the more they will see you as the trusted source of truth.\nCall out the myths.\nQuestion #5: What’s the unlikely answer? §\nGiving people obvious solutions to their problems doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence.\nImagine going to Home Depot and saying you don’t know how to build a shed but want to create one, and the guy says, “Well, we’ve got some wood.”\nBoring.\nInstead, you want to give readers (who you want to inspire to turn into customers) the unlikely solution.\nSo instead of saying, “Well, we’ve got wood,” you want to say, “Did you know you can order a ready-to-live shed straight to your door? It comes pre-made for you.”\nAmazing!\nGive the reader the unlikely answer (the thing they weren’t expecting) and 99% of the time, they’ll want more.\nQuestion #6: What are the benefits of this “road less traveled?” §\nYou’ve told them why they’re stuck in Struggle City…\nYou’ve given them someone/something else to blame…\nYou’ve pulled back the curtain and debunked the myths…\nAnd you’ve given them an “unlikely answer,” unlocking the road less traveled…\nNow it’s time to paint the rainbow at the end.\n\nWhat will the reader experience if they take this less-known road?\nWhat are the benefits of going the opposite way as everyone else?\n\nTell them about the pot of gold!\nQuestion #7: What does their life look like “on the other side?” §\nAh, glory.\nIn order for the reader to make the commitment to go on this journey, they need to know it’ll all be worth it.\nSo, don’t hold back. Tell them everything. Tell them what their life will be like. Tell them all the things that will be different (for good and bad). Be honest. Tell them what they can expect to find, who they can expect to meet, and what they can expect to feel. Paint the vision. Give it to them in 4K, HD.\nHelp them visualize the dream.\nQuestion #8: “Are you ready to transform?” §\nFinally, you have to call the reader to adventure.\nDon’t bury the ask.\nDon’t “assume” they’ll take it upon themselves to figure out how to get started.\nTell them, point blank, “Here’s the first step.” Take them by the hand and show them the way. Be their guide, their mentor. Take care of them. Show (no, PROVE!) that you’ve got them, and you won’t let anything bad happen to them along the way.\nAsk them, “Are you ready to transform?”\nYour Weekly Digital Writing Prompt §\nNot sure what to write about today?\nHere’s a prompt to get the creative juices flowing:\nWhat is your favorite memory as a child?\nIf a moment come rushing back into mind, follow it.

It’s the right thing for the right job.\nBeing fit means that something is adapted. It belongs in its environment. It isn’t out of place. It’s not useless and it’s not extra.\nI think of marathon running as a great example for this. There is no instance in your life, when running a marathon will ever be practical. Yes, it can give you a good sense of accomplishment. Yes it can be a great achievement. But I’m 99% percent sure, you’ll never have to run 42km in a day.\nWe don’t have to hunt for our food anymore. We don’t have to run away from lions.\nUnderstanding the demands of your life §\nAsk yourself then: What do I need to be fit for?\nIt’s a big over arching question, that can be vague and hard to answer. I can break it down into a few more questions.\n\nWhat are the physical demands of your work?\n\nAre you lifting heavy things?\nAre you on your feet?\nAre you hunched over all the time? (That’s physical)\n\n\nWhat about the physical demands of your hobbies?\n\nDo you play basketball on weekends?\nDo you like to go hiking or diving?\nDo you like to go on walks?\n\n\nWho benefits from you being fit?\n\nI can play with my pets\nI can play with my kids\nI can help me wife do work around the house\n\n\nWhat kind of activity would you like to do in 20 years? in 30 years?\n\nI’d like to still be walking every day\nI’d like to be climbing mountains when I’m old\nI’d like to be lifting weights as an old man\n\n\n\nYour answers to these questions might give you some idea of what you’re trying to be fit for. And thus, what fitness looks like to you.\nMaking yourself fit to that §\nIf you understand the goal, and you understand the constraints that you have. Then you can start to make some decision that will help your fitness.\nSay from the questions above, I say. My work is sitting at my computer writing all day. But as a hobby I like to do gardening. I mainly want to benefit my wife by being handy around the house, and as I age, I’d like to still be active, walking, maybe running, playing with kids and grandkids.\nAll these give me the constraits to fit my program towards.\n\nI would try to work on the strain from writing\nI would try to be strong enough to lift soil bags\nI would try to be mobile enough to bend down while working in the garden\nI want to have enough cardio health to be able to walk and run\n\nBut if from the questions above, I say: My work is in a restaurant, and I’m always on my feet. I love trianing for marathons, and I want to help other people run too. As I age, I’d still like to be running long distances.\nThen for me, what it means to be fit is:\n\nI work on my knees and other running muslces\nI think about the long term health of my running\n\nNo one fitness program is good for everyone.\nIn none of the above examples does being fit entail lifting 100s of pouds in bench presses. (That may be fit for some people, but not for everyone). So you can be living a very simple, modest exercise life, and still be very fit!\nFitness is just that. How suited is your workout to your lifestlye.\nRedefining fitness for yourself §\nThis kind of fitness changes over time too.\nAs you grow,\nAnd your life changes.\nWhat it means to be fit changes with it also.\nThis is just the natural progressionof things."},"Notes/A-List-of-My-Favorite-Things":{"title":"A List of My Favorite Things","links":["Frank-Ambrosio","Notes/Hollow-Knight-(story)"],"tags":[],"content":"A List of My Favorite Things §\n\n\nOnline Dante Course\n\nIt actually works like an online illuminated manuscript.\nWhich is such an amazing concept \nby: [Frank Ambrosio]\n\n\n\nHollow Knight (story)\n\nThis game is just brilliant to me\nThe storytelling.

The promise had been a significant part of the political campaign.\nWhat makes this story particularly noteworthy is the work of independent journalist Michael, who dedicated himself to uncovering the truth. Michael’s investigative efforts brought him into contact with many farmers, allowing him to gather firsthand accounts and insights.\nIn an era where journalism is undergoing transformation, independent journalists like Michael continue to be vital contributors to society.

Why? Because over time, the backlinks will overpopulate like weeds, covering up the more valuable connections by their sheer numbers.\nIt’s the same thing that happened to many people in Evernote who saved too many articles.

Over time, you end up scrolling and wasting more and more time hunting for meaningful links amidst all the noise of all the false-positives.

The resulting fall of blood glucose levels causes hunger, irritability, and energy crashes.\nAverage Diet — Even an average diet can still have several micro-nutrient deficiencies that can be the cause of headaches, lower Energy (re Flow) levels, mood swings, a lack of enthusiasm.\nLack of Enthusiasm (re Flow)\nLack of Direction (re Flow)\n\nSolutions to Poor Attention §\n\nReducing Distractions in Intensity and Frequency\nHaving a Good Diet\n"},"Notes/Augmenting-Long-Term-Memory":{"title":"Augmenting Long Term Memory","links":[],"tags":["-learning-memory-"],"content":"http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html"},"Notes/Autonomous-vehicles":{"title":"Autonomous vehicles","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Autonomous vehicles §\nThis was about designing objects that respond to their environments\nThis was in the context of computer programming.\nVehicles\nA book:\nExperiments in synthetic psychology\nby Valentino braitenberg"},"Notes/Autonomy-according-to-GMB":{"title":"Autonomy according to GMB","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Autonomy according to GMB §\nContext §\nThis is a really good idea for me\nThe way they articulate it §\nSource §\n\n\n\nKey Idea §\n\nBeing able to do the things you want to do\nTraining for the life you want to live\nAutonomy is freedom.\n\nI’m in control\nI can make decisions.\n\n\nI’m not held back by my body.\nI can do the things that I want to do\n"},"Notes/Avoid-Overtraining-by-Logging":{"title":"Avoid Overtraining by Logging","links":["Notes/A-Second-brain-for-your-workouts","Notes/Brain-is-for-having-ideas-not-for-holding-them"],"tags":[],"content":"Avoid overtraining with a log §\nContext §\nOvertraining happens to some people\nWhat is it §\nLogging\nWhat am I keeping track off\nI find logging really hard and challenging.\nIt gets boring;

The key to sustainable progress lies in adopting a “builder mindset.” This mindset is not just about constructing something new but also about understanding the foundational ‘why’ behind each action.\nTo maintain this balance, especially for those who naturally lean towards a more relaxed approach, it’s crucial to continually interrogate your ‘why.’ Start with the immediate reason and keep asking “why do I care about that?” until you reach the core motivation. This exercise serves as a compass, ensuring that you’re aligned with your deepest values and objectives, thereby enabling you to operate optimally in “builder mode.”\nThis is not just a mental exercise but a tool for recalibration.

Below is a list of benefits derived from having your notes equipped with fluid frameworks like a Home note and Maps of Content.\n\nBenefits §\nProvides Reliability §\nHaving a Home note and MOCs act as reliable home bases to re-ground your thoughts whenever they begin to waver. Like a parent to a five-year old, linked frameworks like MOCs are a consistent and comforting safety net.\nDisregard this at your own peril.  1\nProvides Flexibility §\n\nFluid Frameworks like the Home note and Maps of Content don’t limit access; they curate it.\n\nThey are like a top-notch concierge that directs you to where you want to be.\nSee Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea.\nLaunches the Brain §\nThe LYT framework is filled with your personalized reminders of important categories of knowledge and their key terms. It helps kickstart the brain—reducing the activation energy needed to start thinking and connecting ideas.\nEnhances Note Retrieval §\nNote retrieval becomes easier when you’re staring at many possible access points: your main categories, contexts, maps, and tags. 2 Notes become tethered like Wolverine:\n\nAlleviates Overwhelm §\nMOCs Overview (MOCs) are your key to adding structure to the chaos, especially as your digital library grows. The ability to sense the tickle of anxiety and build an MOC is oftentimes the difference between a finished project and an abandoned one.\nEncourages Relational, Positional Thinking §\nMaking a Map of Content forces a rich, engaging relational battle between notes. Notes jockey for position in your brain, and each placement by you embeds them with additional meaning.\nAids in Linking with Pre-built Contexts §\nYour 10 or so main maps provide a pre-built latticework upon which to hang your new notes. It’s a personalized classification system for your digital knowledge. Tethering to these hub-like maps vastly enhance long-term storage and retrieval.\nFuture-Proofs for your Future Self §\nThere are months that go by where I don’t open my digital library. Before adopting plain text and adding structure, I would get anxiety when I would finally re-open it. Now, however, I don’t get that anxiety because I have my trusty Home note, Maps of Content and other fluid ways of categorizing and retrieving info. In no time, I’m back up to speed and off to the races.\nImproves Memory §\nTransclude of block dbdd21\nBecause of the well-traveled structural pathways that the Home note and Maps of Content encourage, my recall has improved. This makes sense because of three important factors that working with “linked frameworks” encourages:\n\nReps - I’m constantly returning to a home view and then re-launching into new directions in my digital library.\nConceptual Thinking - Making MOCs forces you to really consider the unique qualities of the thought you’re holding and how it relates to other thoughts. This conceptual [[thinking through linking]] strengthens neural connections—making Cobwebs into Cables.\nSpatial Context - Your main MOCs are numbered and always at the top of the sidebar (when sorted A to Z). This way, they act as a spatial map. We remember things much better when we have a spatial constellation of related things.\n\nIncreases Satisfaction §\nWe spend too much time with our notes not to experience joy with them. LYT structures allow you to fly around your digital library with the deftness of a surgeon and the joy of a chimpanzee swinging from branch to branch.\n%%\n\nDid you know this article is LIVE online right now, but no one online can see these hidden “comments” except us :)\nWow, this note uses at least 18 different formatting methods:\ninternal links, embeds, headers, dividers, emphasis with bolds, italics, bold+italics, lists, images, piped links, external links, blockquotes, inline code, tables, strikethroughs, highlights, footnotes, and comments. \n\nThe first three benefits as a table §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefitDescriptionProvides ReliabilityReliable places to ground thoughtsProvides FlexibilityFluid frameworks don’t limit, they curateLaunches the BrainJump Kickstarts your brain\n%%\n\nNext §\nThe benefits are exhaustive—and we haven’t even talked about Idea Emergence!\nBut you may still be asking: Is LYT For Me?\nFootnotes §\n\n\nDo not underestimate the peace of mind that comes from a reliable, dependable digital library.

A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won 11 NBA championships during his 13-year career.[2] Russell and Henri Richard of the National Hockey League are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.[3] Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He led the San Francisco Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956,[4] and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[5]\nDespite his limitations on offense, as Russell averaged 15.1 points per game, his rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era.[6][7][8][9] Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) arm span,[10][11] his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics’ dominance during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities, and he led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[12] and remains second all time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.[13]\nRussell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in the NBA and the first to win a championship.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15]\nRussell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[5] one of only four players to receive all three honors, and selected into the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP Award in his honor.[16] In 2021, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time for his coaching career.[17] Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell’s jersey number 6 league-wide, becoming the only player in NBA history to receive the honor.[18]"},"Notes/Biodynamic-Farming-in-the-Philippinies":{"title":"Biodynamic Farming in the Philippinies","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/soil","tags/composting"],"tags":["idea-note","soil","composting"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#soil#composting\nurl: https://www.downtoearth.ph/biodynamic-composting/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nWe get ours from Greg Kitma of PhilBio\nSee also §"},"Notes/Bitcoin-perhaps-is-more-like-jewelery-that-currency":{"title":"Bitcoin perhaps is more like jewelery that currency","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Bitcoin perhaps is more like jewelery that currency"},"Notes/Black-Soldier-Fly-Resources":{"title":"Black Soldier Fly Resources","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://www.evoconsys.com/blog/house-fly-inhibition-by-black-soldier-fly-how-do-they-do-it\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00987968\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Grow-Black-Soldier-Flies\nhttps://kimmyfarm.com/en/black-soldier-flies-calcium-worm-breeding-techniques\nhttps://www.thecritterdepot.com/blogs/news/how-to-breen-black-soldier-fly-larvae"},"Notes/Blind-guy-Travels-podcast-(story)":{"title":"Blind guy Travels podcast (story)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Blind guy travels (podcast) §\nCan’t make facial expressions\nBecause he can’t copy\nWhich is inate to us\nThis is why blind people have a bit of that blank expression.\nIt’s something that I took for granted\nBecause you don’t even think about how you copy facial expressions"},"Notes/Blockchain-and-search-engines":{"title":"Blockchain and search engines","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1406400770581303297\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Blockchains-and-Transparency":{"title":"Blockchains and Transparency","links":["Maps/Web3-MOC","Notes/The-trap-of-giving-up-religion-for-science","Notes/Science-can-be-just-as-cherry-picky-as-religion"],"tags":[],"content":"up:: Web3 MOC\nX:: The trap of giving up religion for science\ntags:: web3\nnovelty::\nLink to Reference §\nurl: Interview: Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum\nKey Ideas §\nLike what democracies aspire to be, a blockchain is highly open and transparent, and anyone can verify that the rules are being followed.

But if you’re feeling relaxed, your mind reflects that in your body also.\nThis plays a big role when it comes to injury and recovery.\nOne of the most well-known examples of the mind-body connection is the placebo effect. \nThis is when someone takes a “fake” treatment, like a sugar pill, but experiences real health benefits because they believe the treatment will work.\nPlacebo effects have been documented in a variety of studies and are now considered an important part of many medical treatments.\nSo, what does all this mean for you?\nIt means you have to practice some mental fitness as a part of your recovery process\n—\nWe all have inner saboteurs. \nThese are the voices inside our heads that tell us we’re not good enough, that we can’t do it, or that we’re going to fail. \nIt’s the voice of fear, or the voice of perfectionism, or even the judging voice that we all have. (This is in everybody, it’s okay and there’s nothing wrong with that in itself)\nRemember back in the previous video, we talked about the physical pain we experience. Physical pain is not bad- it has a useful function for survival and keeping safe. It’s becomes a problem when it goes overboard.\nThe same thing with our inner saboteur voices.\nWhen it comes to your body and injuries- it’s that voice that tries everything to keep you from your recovery.\nThat voice might tell you that your body is weak, and not recovered. It might tell you that you’re going to injure yourself again if you get back into exercise and activity.\nSometimes that voice will tell you that you were stupid to get yourself injured in the first place! (My voice does this all the time) It tells me that I was being dumb and always putting myself in danger. I would be better off if I didn’t do anything instead.\nYour voice might say that it’s not important to you right now, and that you can put it off for next time. There are all sorts of excuses that your saboteur can use to keep you from taking action and getting out of an injured mindset.\nSo next time you hear your inner saboteur speaking, remember that it’s the voice of fear. It has a role, but it cannot control your whole life.\n–\nWhat should you do instead?\nIn the same way you have an inner saboteur that sabotages you, you also have an inner sage.\nYou can call it many things- your true self, your best self, even your inner coach.\nYour sage is the part of that knows what you need to do. It comes from a place of calm, trust and wisdom. The challenge is that we are out of practice when it comes to listening to that sage wisdom.\nBecause of the many things in our environment or society.\nSo if you’re having trouble with your injury. And it keeps bringing up anxiety, perfectionism, and other negative thought patterns. You can practice listening to your inner sage.\nInstead of letting your saboteurs win, start learning to trust your inner sage. \n–\nRemember, when it comes to your recovery the mind is a powerful tool that can work for or against you.\nYou might say, isn’t this a self fulfilling prophecy? If I’m optimistic and positive, then of course things will improve.\nbut if I’m negative and stuck in saboteurs thinking, then I’ll go in that direction also.\nThe answer is yes and no. It is a self fulfilling prophecy in the sense that what we focus on develops. While what we ignore gets weaker.\nMy favorite image to think about this is a trail in the woods. I like to go on on hikes, and sometimes I find myself in a place where the trail is bad and difficult. The problem is that I don’t have a better path to take- so I stick to the bad path. \nIt’s a lot of hard work to forge a new and better path when I’m on a hike. But if I have a guide, we can plan out a good route together. Plus, once I get on a good path once- the next time, I’ll have an easier time finding it.\nOver time, if I follow the good path enough- I start to remember how to get there. The trail becomes easier to spot. My hike becomes a lot easier.\nLetting ourselves get taken over by negative saboteur thinking gets us stuck in that bad path. For injuries, it can be believing that things will never get better. Or that our bodies will never be the same again.\nIf we focus on negativity, we will trap ourselves in that negative thinking pattern.\nBut, it is also true that we have the power to choose our thoughts and emotions. By choosing to listen to our wise sage, we can start to forge a new and better path to recovery. It is challenging for sure, especially in the beginning. But over time it gets easier and easier.\n–\nFor now, it is good to explore- what are some of the negative ideas I have surrounding my body and my injury?\nDon’t worry about getting rid of those thoughts right now. Like many important things, it takes time and practice.\nBut being aware of the negative saboteur thoughts that keep coming to you is a great first step. By having those in mind, and even writing them down- you’ll setting yourself up for choosing a better path in the future.\n**"},"Notes/Building-your-own-health-system":{"title":"Building your own health system","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1485206537455149059 §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nAt the end of the day, you can’t just copy-paste someone else’s health system and expect it to work for you.

There are good reasons for your body and your mind to resist the change\nThat reminds me that Why we always resist change. And for good reason. It’s so that the brain can be more efficient and take shortcuts.\nIt’s important because if you understand what your brain is doing, then you can understand why you resist change so much!\n\nRead more at: Why Change Is so Hard — and How to Deal with It\nGo one level up : Learning MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Path dependence"},"Notes/Changing-a-habit-is-really-about-replacing-a-routine":{"title":"Changing a habit is really about replacing a routine","links":["Notes/Defining-a-habit","tags/habit","Natural-Selection","Notes/Habit-formation-provides-an-evolutionary-advantage","Notes/How-Atomic-Habits-fit-into-the-conversation-on-habits"],"tags":["habit"],"content":"up:: Defining a habit\ntags::#habit\nChanging a habit is really about replacing a routine §\nDuhigg’s book, while full of the requisite filler of long pop-science stories, breaks ground on providing a simple habit formation process.1\nHabits are incredibly resilient: in some cases, people with extensive brain damage who could not even remember where they lived could still adhere to their old habits and pick up new ones. This is because learning and maintaining habits happens in the basal ganglia, a part of your brain that can function normally even if the rest of your brain is damaged.\nUnfortunately, this resilience means that even if you kick a bad habit, like smoking, you will always be at risk of relapsing.\nHabits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort and therefore endure. They are Natural Selection in action. See: Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage.\nHabits stick because they create craving.\n\ngolden rule of changing any habit: don’t resist craving, redirect it\n\ndo this by keeping the cue and the reward and just replacing the routine.\n\n\n\nWhat Keystone Habits are really about, and probably why I’ve always struggled with the term, 1 is because behavioral change is really driven by small wins—ie early victories that are relatively easy to reach. Therefore it’s “small wins” and not “keystone habits” that help you viscerally believe that change is possible.\nWhat Duhigg—and over 500 research articles who referenced Baumeister’s work—got wrong: “Willpower is the most important keystone habit.” No, it’s not. This finding, which is false, directed my attentions for the next several years, only to realize that willpower is way, way overrated and the studies were rotten (looking at you Baumeister!).\nFollowing habits is not only a key part of our lives but also a key part of organizations and companies. All habits comprise a cue-routine-reward loop, and the easiest way to change this is to substitute the routine for something else while keeping the cue and reward the same. Achieving lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such as willpower.\nFootnotes §\n\n\nToo simple perhaps, because in making the process super sticky with only 3 steps, he left out an important fourth step between Cue and Routine: Craving.

This notion resonates with the idea that “homo cinematicus is homo ludens,” revealing the profound impact of cinema on our lives.\nDirectorial styles can be likened to different liturgies, each offering a distinct lens through which we perceive truth. While this concept applies to cinema as a whole, some auteurs embody it with exceptional clarity. Wes Anderson, for instance, unmistakably captures our senses, drawing us into his vivid and meticulously crafted worlds. His films, in a sense, become rites of passage, inviting us to engage more deeply.\nBut Wes Anderson is not alone in this endeavor. Other directors, like Paul Schrader, bring their unique perspectives to the cinematic ritual. Schrader’s exploration of reality through his lens adds yet another layer to the tapestry of cinematic liturgy. It’s through these directors and their distinctive visions that we can appreciate the full spectrum of human experience in the world of cinema.\n\nRead more at: Wes Anderson’s Chafings Against the Immanent Frame: An Addendum | Church Life Journal | University of Notre Dame\nGo one level up : Spirituality MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Disappearing Art Of Maintenance"},"Notes/Circular-saw-for-steel":{"title":"Circular saw for steel","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Circular saw for steel §\nRemember, you can’t use your woodworking mitre saw for steel!\nVincenzo Karpintero talks about this.\nYou can’t just use the same circular saw.\nI think when the time comes, I’ll just ask for help from Vincenzo!"},"Notes/Classic-psychedelics-in-the-treatment-of-substance-use-disorder-Potential-synergies-with-twelve-step-programs":{"title":"Classic psychedelics in the treatment of substance use disorder Potential synergies with twelve-step programs","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353485146_Classic_psychedelics_in_the_treatment_of_substance_use_disorder_Potential_synergies_with_twelve-step_programs\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Coaches-Need-Coaches":{"title":"Coaches Need Coaches","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coaches need coaches\nhttps://twitter.com/JLPGomez/status/1438290329694785537"},"Notes/Cobra-Effect-in-British-India-(analogy)":{"title":"Cobra Effect in British India (analogy)","links":["Notes/Goodhart's-Law-(mental-models)"],"tags":[],"content":"Cobra Effect in British India §\nOptimizing to one metric,\ncan affect your overall performance.\nLet’s say the metric is\nI want to run a 10k in under 30 minutes\nYou might ignore some things in order to push those boundaries\nProblem solving the wrong way\nTeaching to the test\nCreates bad applications\nThis is teaching to the test\nand there are many manifestations of this\nSee also\nGoodhart’s Law (mental models)"},"Notes/Cobwebs-into-Cables":{"title":"Cobwebs into Cables","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/concept","Notes/Reps"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#concept\nCobwebs into Cables §\nTurning cobwebs into cables is a metaphor for strengthening neural connections through getting Reps.\n\n“Neurons that fire together wire together” - Hebb’s Rule\n"},"Notes/Coccygodynia":{"title":"Coccygodynia","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coccygodynia §\nKey Idea §\n\nThis is a tailbone thing\nI’m researching it for Alexa\n\nPiriformis Stretch\nLunge type (can be lying down)\nHamstring\nIntertwist and stretch"},"Notes/Coffeehouse-as-a-kind-of-penny-Univeristy":{"title":"Coffeehouse as a kind of penny Univeristy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coffeehouse as a kind of penny Univeristy §\nBut a cup of coffee\nAnd the learn from the people around you"},"Notes/Cognitive-Functional-Therapy-1":{"title":"Cognitive Functional Therapy 1","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: http://www.pain-ed.com/blog/2019/04/18/cft-infographic/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nThis is the pain infographic that’s so good\nAnd so that if I search pain infographic this will show up for sure\nSee also §"},"Notes/Cognitive-Functional-Therapy":{"title":"Cognitive Functional Therapy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Cohabitation-is-a-luxury-belief":{"title":"Cohabitation is a luxury belief","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/marriage","tags/cohabitation","tags/luxury-belief","Notes/Luxury-Beliefs"],"tags":["idea-note","marriage","cohabitation","luxury-belief"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#marriage#cohabitation#luxury-belief\nurl: https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/no-one-expects-young-men-to-do-anything?s=r\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nRob Henderson’s stuff\nI like him because he’s a smart conservative\nKey Idea §\nThe idea that cohabiting partnerships are good is a luxury belief\nBecause if you you money, the problems that come with a cohabiting partnership not working out are less detrimental\nBut when people without money try to do this it doesn’t really work out as well for them\nSee also §\nLuxury Beliefs"},"Notes/CohereDAO-and-Inequality-and-Social-Justice":{"title":"CohereDAO and Inequality and Social Justice","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/on/coheredao","tags/consciousness","tags/local-community","tags/regenerative"],"tags":["idea-note","on/coheredao","consciousness","local-community","regenerative"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#on/coheredao#consciousness#local-community#regenerative\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/626a42d01239922546884a41\nhttps://www.airr.io/quote/626a4354123992254688bc44\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nI want to be conscious of this.

Are you clear on your direction? It’s worth noting that even if this activity isn’t part of your big goals in life, you can still be in flow as long as you are clear on what you’re doing in the moment. Essentially, you are clear on your next steps, your micro-direction, your micro-goals.\n\n\nClear and immediate feedback — How am I doing?\n\nClarity of Direction (re Flow) is the biggest factor here.\n\n\nA balance between perceived challenge and skill — If I’m not in flow, what can I do to help induce it?\n\nConceptually, this is the holy grail. Practically, you gotta deftly adjust your current situation. Technically, there are specific “recipes” to use that will help. Balancing Challenge and Skill is the most important condition because it’s the result of every element that dictates quality experience: Direction (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow), Attention (re Flow), and Energy (re Flow).\n\n\n\nNow that we have a clear list of the conditions of flow, we need to relate them to the Four Factors of Flow.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2012\ncreated:: 2012\nrevised:: 2014\nrevised:: 2016\nrevised:: 2019\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Connaturality-(idea)":{"title":"Connaturality (idea)","links":["Notes/Forming-Habits-(concept)","Notes/Misconception-when-it-comes-to-forming-habits"],"tags":[],"content":"public:: false\nConnaturality (concept) §\nHow things come easily for some people\nForming Habits (concept)\nIt’s\n\n\ncopy first\nI.e. find some good role models\nFind someone who’s style you like\nTry it on for size\n\n\nmake that a habit\nDo it regularly.\nThere’s no real science on how long this actually takes\nForming Habits (concept)\nMisconception when it comes to forming habits\nis about the misconcepcion of 21 days of learning\n\n\ndiscover your style\n\n\nbecome intuitive\n\n"},"Notes/Conscious-Creation-of-Health":{"title":"Conscious Creation of Health","links":["tags/idea-note","Notes/202111212045--Conscious-Health-Creation"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\n\nRiffing of Cole’s ideas\n\nKey Idea §\n\nIf you know the elements, then you can build it consciously, instead of stumbling upon good practices\nFour elements\n\nEnjoyment\nSocial\nHeart rate?\nNovelty?\n\n\n\nWhen people practice any fad diet.

Pushing myself as a writer has always been important to me, and I know that at River Tech, I’ll have the opportunity to grow and expand my skills while creating quality content for your team.\nDuring my time at Hawaii Western, I majored in English with an emphasis in Business Writing. This enabled me to focus on developing my technical writing skills. In fact, I was able to present my thesis not only at Hawaii Western but at a local conference as well. This assisted me not only in developing my writing abilities but in helping me hone my public speaking skills.\nMy previous position at Cloud Clearwater provided me with an incredible opportunity. I was able to revamp our company’s internal memo system to reflect updated verbiage and wording. Additionally, I participated in creating social media and digital platform content for the organization. This helped expand our social media following by over 50% in just three months.\nThank you for your time and consideration. As someone who is detail-oriented, driven, and dedicated to creating fantastic work, I’m looking forward to learning more about the Writer position at River Tech.

Do you follow the well-trodden trail, or carve your own? The lure of conformity is often strong; it’s the trail everyone else is taking, after all. But what if you create your own path, one laden with untapped opportunities?\nWhen you venture into uncharted waters, you might become the big fish in a small pond. Here’s where your accrued wisdom, your “knowledge of 100,” becomes a monumental advantage. In my own search for a sense of belonging and purpose, I’ve realized that facing unique challenges requires specialized solutions. You don’t want to be a generalist in a market full of specialists. Aim instead to be the specialist in a market that hasn’t even realized the need for one yet. In doing so, you’re not just outclassing the competition; you’re creating a new game altogether.\nThink about it: when you’re the pioneer, not only do you set the rules, but you also get to choose your competitors. Opt to play against those who are less sophisticated in the arena you’ve chosen. They may be experts in their fields, but if their expertise doesn’t extend to your particular pond, then you’ve instantly set yourself apart.\nImagine you’re a hunter-gatherer, and you’ve just discovered a forest abundant with game that your tribe hasn’t found yet. You know the hunting techniques, you’ve practiced them, and now you’ve found a place where these skills shine the brightest. You’re not just a hunter; you’re the go-to person for this new resource.\nBeing the big fish in a small pond isn’t about underestimating others but about maximizing your own capabilities and insights. It’s a conscious decision to apply your extensive knowledge to situations where it can make the most impact, thus increasing your chances of smart decisions without merely relying on luck.\n\nRead more at: How to Make Smart Decisions Without Getting Lucky\nGo one level up : Personal Brand MOC\nYou may also be interested in: 202208011440- What makes me different"},"Notes/Dedirot-effect":{"title":"Dedirot effect","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dedirot effect §\nBought more possessions story\nUpgrade everything\nIt’s when you end up buying more shit\nbecause you bought more shit\n** This is going to happen to us with this ridgeview house"},"Notes/Deep-Health-Workshop-(Talk)":{"title":"Deep Health Workshop (Talk)","links":["Notes/The-Value-of-a-Life-Dashboard"],"tags":[],"content":"What is Deep Health? §\nKey Idea 1: Your life is interconnected §\nAnalogy / Story §\nIn some schools they showed that those who exercise before class.\nScore better in the SATs\nIdea §\nWe mistakenly think that different aspects of our life are separate §\nWe tend to think that we can compartmentalize the aspects of our lives.\nSo when I go for a run, I feel “I’m benefiting my body.” Not my mind.\nOr when I’m reading a book, I say, “I’m improving my mind”\nOr now I’m going to spend time with friends, I’ll say “I’m working on my relationships.”\nWe think of things like boxes. Or like apps on a phone. §\nWe click one app and we do that one things. And then when we close the app it’s done.\nWorkout is one app.\nRelationships is another app.\nWhat we eat is a different app.\nThis approach is too compartmentalized\nInstead, I want you to think of health as something else altogether.\nWhat if health is more like trying to fall asleep.\nI’m going to sleep!!\nI need to sleep!!\nI want to sleep!!\nYou’re never going to fall asleep.\nThat’s never going to work.\nBut you have to tackle it indirectly.\nInstead of willfully working on something.\nYou have to work around it.\nAnd you’ll improve it.\nPulling on one string to move another (Leverage) §\nI can’t force my health to move in the right direction.\nBut I can tweak things around it.\nAnd make things move it.\nRue goldberg machine\nGears\nLeverage\nThis works because unlike APPS on a PHONE, being healthy is not separate things like your body, or your mind, or your food.\nEverything is connected. The secret to understanding health is to realize that everything is connected. What you eat has an effect on how you feel. And how you feel affects your motivation to workout. Working out affects your mood which affects your friendships.\nIt’s a lot to take in, but I think you’re already part way there.\nThe Mental Health Examples §\nWe’re living through a mental health revolution.\nTake for example mental health. May people today understand that mental health is an important part of our wellbeing.\nWays to improve mental health §\nLook at this list\nIt’s different strategies to improve mental health\nBut they’re not just focused on the brain or the mind\nThey’re focused on different aspects of your life.\nIf you care about mental health, then you’re already on your way to understanding health very well.\nYou already understand, that to take care of your mental health, you work on every aspect of your life.\nYou can work on your mental health directly, but you can also work on it by exploring other aspects also.\nSame Idea expanded. Everything in your experience is connected §\nTake that idea from mental health, and blow that up, and you have this concept called deep health.\nThe truth is, all things in your experience are connected. Your body is connected to your mind. And also your body is connected to your relationships, and to your environment. That is the main idea for today. What makes you healthy is not just what you do in the gym. Or what you eat on your plate.\nHow much time you spend with people that care about you and support you makes you healthy. Having a connection with something larger than yourself is part of health. The city or place you live in is part of you’re health.\nSo when I say, I want to be healthy. I usually mean, I want to exercise more, and I want to eat better food. But it should also mean, that I want to cultivate supportive relationships, and I want to live in an environment that’s good for me.\nEverything goes well at the same time\nEverything goes wrong at the same time\nExample §\nLook at this example. Michael sleeps late, and he doesn’t get a good night’s sleep. He wakes up and feels cranky. Because of that, he’s mean to his friends. Sarcastic and sassy. Then he works out, he’s more likely to get injured.\nOn the other hand\nYou eat a good meal before your exam.\nAnd you’re able to perform well.\nIf you relax.\nyou don’t have indigestion.\nThis is what is called Deep Health §\n(Show the deep health diagram)\nWhat I’ve just described above is what I like to call Deep Health. It’s an idea that I borrowed from other health coaches and some counselors.\nDeep health is another way of saying that being healthy is more than being physically fit. Deep health covers all dimensions of your life, including physical fitness. And if you want to be healthy for a long time, you can try to approach it from a deep health perspective.\nWhat health researchers know is this:\n\nEverything in our lives are connected.\nIf you are thriving in one area, then other areas of your life will get “propped up”\n\nFor example, if you get a good night’s sleep (physical), you’re more likely to do well in an exam or presentation (mental), you’re also more patient and kind to people around you (relational)\n\n\nConversely, if one area is struggling, other areas can be affected as well\n\nFor example, if someone is judgemental or unsupportive of your goals (relational), it might affect your eating habits, and sleep (physical). It may even make you doubt yourself deeply (existential)\n\n\n\nAnswer the survey §\nThe Value of a Life Dashboard\nhttps://www.precisionnutrition.com/deep-health\nHere’s another footnote\nI hope you have a basic understanding of deep health now. The next step is to go over each area, and try to understand- what areas am I doing well in? What areas come naturally to me? Where do I have inherent strengths? Where do I have inherent weaknesses?\nThis will give you some idea of how to design your health pratices well.\nGoing over each area §\nGetting a “Deep health” snapshot\n(at this point, I’ll ask them to draw the diagram, and we’ll fill it up togehter)\nPhysical Health §\nPhysical health is what everyone thinks of when they think of being healthy.\nThat’s exercise and diet.\nAsk yourself here,\n\nHow do you feel about your exercise and movement right now?\nAnd how do you feel about the food that you’re eating right now?\n\nScore yourself higher here if:\nScore yourself lower her if:\nDo you have the physical freedom to do the things you want to do? Or is something holding you back? Like a bad back, or rickety knees?\nIf you’re happy with your physical health, the way you move and eat, then give yourself a higher score here. If you’d like to improve things, you can place yourself where you think you are.\nEmotional Health §\nEmotional health focuses on the question: How well can I handle my emotions? Am I able to express my emotions appropriately?\nScore yourself higher here if: §\nScore yourself lower here if: §\nThese days, how is your emotional health?\nMental Health §\nMental health over here is different from the mental health we talked about above. Here, the question to answer is, “Does my brain feel engaged by the things I am doing in my day?”\nScore yourself higher if:\n\nThese days, I feel really engaged with my work and hobbies.\nI like the problems that I’m encountering now. I like trying to solve them\nI feel stimulated during my day.\n\nScore yourself lower if:\n\nThese days I feel quite bored and uninterested\nI feel like I’m mostly doing things mindlessly\nI can’t even remember how I spent my day\n\nExistential Health §\nExistential Health talks about your sense of purpose. Do you have a goal and clear motivation for yourself. Do you know why you do the things you do?\nScore yourself higher here if:\n\nI feel like I’m building towards my future\nI can imagine\n\nScore yourself lower here if:\n\nI feel like I’m stuck\n\nRelational Health §\nRelational Health has to do with the people around you. Are you supported by close friends and relatives? Do you have people in your life that can help you with your goals?\nScore yourself high\n\nYou have someone you can talk to when you’re in distress\n\nScore yourself low if:\n\nYou feel more disconnected and isolated\nYou feel like you’re struggling alone\n\nWhat do you need from your loved ones in order to help you work on your health\nEnvironmental Health §\nEnvironmental Health has to do with the space you find yourself in. This can be many things. Are you surrounded by green and life where you live? Are you happy with your home? Your city?\nScore yourself higher here if:\n\nYour environment makes it easier for you to be health\n\nScore yourself lower here if:\n\nYou feel unsafe or insecure with where you live\nYou feel restricted by factors that are outside of your control.\n\nIs there any way to change your environment, to help you meet your goals?\nBreakout rooms will go here. §\n(How is this going to happen)\nBringing it back and getting ideas in §\nIs it Overwhelming or Empowering? §\nThe challenge is that problems are connected.\nThe good news is that solutions are connected too!\nFocus on your strengths!\nDon’t force yourself, “trick” yourself.\nRelational is strong for you?\nInstead of forcing yourself to exercise or eat well\nRecruit some friends to do it with you.\nMental is strong for you?\nInstead of forcing yourself to exercise\nWhy don’t you do some research- Study and see what you learn. This may motivate you more\n(I have booklists)\nKey takeaway for me here:\nBut the perspective I like to take is that there are many things you can do! If you can’t exercise right now, because it’s the pandemic, that’s okay. You can spend time with family- and you’re still taking care of your health by doing that.\nPull your health by focusing on different things.\nKey Idea 2: It looks different for every person §\nAnalogy §\nWho’s the healthiest here\nBodybuilder-\nFather who spends time with their kids\nStudent who hangs out with friends, volunteers at a hospital.\n—\nThe fish swim thing from Einstein\nthe image of the test?\nSomething that talks about best fit.\nIdea §\nDeep health looks different for each of us. What it means for you to be healthy is very different than what it means for me to be healthy.\nThe best example that we’re all familiar with here is the different between introverts and extroverts. An introvert will spend their night chatting with a friend online, and they can feel that their relational score for deep health is good. But for an extrovert, that might not be enough. So they would score themselves lower in that situation.\nBut for some people. It makes them self conscious. They feel awkward. They can’t focus on their movements.\nSo for different people, the social support for them to be healthy looks different.\nBut this is true for all dimensions!\nMaybe for physical exercise- you like to go on long runs. And that’s really motivating for you. But another person like to swim. Someone else likes yoga.\nThere’s no one best workout. There’s just the best workout for you.\nKey Idea 3: Try running mini-deep-health experiments. §\nAnalogy §\nI’m going to go to the gym everyday FOR THE WHOLE YEAR\nExploring and being surprised\nThe best travel stories\nCISV - You don’t know what to expect\nIdea §\nBecuase different things work for different people, you’re going to have to try out things for yourself. And to make it much less overwhelming, I found that doing small mini experiments through the year are much better to learn.\n\n\nConsider your deep health\n\n\nThink about what you’d like to work on\n\n\nI follow this template\n\n\nFor the next 10 days, I’m going to work on ((pick an area)) by trying to ((pick an activity)). ((Pick a person)) is going to help me by ((some specific way))\nTwo weeks later:\nAfter trying to ((activity)) for two weeks, I noticed that ((What worked well)). I also noticed that I struggled with ((what was difficult)). If I do this again I would consider ((some alternatives))\n—\n10 days, so that it’s not such a big commitment."},"Notes/Deep-Health-and-all-the-factors":{"title":"Deep Health and all the factors","links":[],"tags":["-holistic-health-factors-on/deep-why-deep-health"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nOn Being with Krista Tippett\nKimberley Wilson — Whole Body Mental Health\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/6299cc37e6f4a6f5a94aa92b\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nHow much of your stress or health is\nhow much sleep you’re getting\nOr what you’re eating?\nHow can we make little improvements\nHow much is relationships?\nHow much is your trauma?\nSee also §"},"Notes/Defining-a-habit":{"title":"Defining a habit","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","Notes/Feedback-Loop","Notes/Habits-carry-a-ton-of-hidden-inertia","Notes/Changing-a-habit-is-really-about-replacing-a-routine"],"tags":["habit"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit\nDefining a habit §\nA habit is a mirror, it gives what you give it—and what you were given is what you’ll give.

The freedom to step away from the daily grind, to rediscover forgotten hobbies or explore new landscapes, is alluring. But it’s not just a simple pause; it’s a complex interplay of emotional and practical considerations.\nThe emotional hurdles are real and varied: anxiety about future employment, shame for needing a break, guilt for wanting one, and even the fear that the freedom might be too seductive. These feelings aren’t just fleeting thoughts; they’re deeply ingrained narratives that can hold us back. It’s like standing on the edge of a cliff, paralyzed by the dizzying array of “what-ifs.”\nOn the flip side, the practicalities can’t be ignored. Financial stability is a big one. If you’re building a business that’s not yet profitable, the idea of taking time off might seem ludicrous. But here’s a counterintuitive thought: What if the sabbatical is what you need to recharge and come back with a fresh perspective that could turn your business around?\nThe key is to plan meticulously.

A prevailing notion is that doctors tend to avoid aggressive treatments when facing terminal illness, opting for palliative care that focuses more on comfort and quality of life. This is backed by data indicating that hospice care may, counterintuitively, extend life compared to aggressive interventions.\nHowever, it’s crucial to recognize that this narrative isn’t a one-size-fits-all. Some doctors do fight tooth and nail, perhaps propelled by their deep-rooted knowledge or even ego. Others find a middle ground, taking a personalized journey that intertwines medical rationality with personal spirituality. Thus, while access to comprehensive information is a potent tool, it is not the sole compass guiding one’s choices at the end of life.\nInstead, perhaps the most impactful “treatment” comes from within—aligning one’s spirituality with the hard, often uncomfortable facts at hand. This is akin to blending two opposing forces: the rigidity of medical evidence and the fluidity of spiritual belief. The convergence of these elements could be seen as the health sector’s equivalent of jazz improvisation—improvising a tune on the fly, even as you read from a well-known musical score.\nSo, does the medical community’s approach to end-of-life care reflect universal wisdom or is it a form of professional bias? The answer likely lies in the individual’s personal and spiritual domain, transcending what can be captured by clinical studies or professional consensus. Making a final decision involves a personal “alchemy” that balances the known with the unknown, the physical with the spiritual.\nAnd as in any alchemical process, the end result is both transformative and deeply personal—a life choice uniquely your own.\n\nRead more at: How Doctors Die | Essay | Zócalo Public Square\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: What happens if we never die"},"Notes/Dometic-mini-freezer":{"title":"Dometic mini freezer","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dometic mini freezer §\nOverland pros"},"Notes/Don-Bosco":{"title":"Don Bosco","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Saint Don Bosco was an Italian Roman Catholic priest who dedicated his life to the education and care of disadvantaged youth in the 19th century. He is known for his innovative teaching methods and his strong belief in the value of practical, hands-on learning.\nBorn in 1815 in Turin, Italy, Don Bosco was the youngest of three children. He grew up in poverty and experienced the struggles of being a disadvantaged youth firsthand. Despite these challenges, he excelled in his studies and was eventually ordained as a priest in 1841.\nAfter his ordination, Don Bosco began working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. He quickly realized that traditional methods of education were not effective for these boys, who were often uninterested in academics and more interested in practical skills. In response, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture.\nDon Bosco’s innovative methods proved to be highly successful, and he quickly gained a reputation as a compassionate and effective educator. He also founded the Salesian Society, a group of priests and laypeople dedicated to the education and care of disadvantaged youth. The Salesian Society still exists today and has spread to countries all over the world.\nIn addition to his work with disadvantaged youth, Don Bosco was also a strong advocate for the rights of workers and was deeply involved in the labor movement of his time. He believed that education and work were key components of a fulfilling and meaningful life, and he worked tirelessly to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they needed to succeed.\nDon Bosco was beatified in 1929 and canonized as a saint in 1934. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer in education and a model of compassion and service. His legacy lives on through the work of the Salesian Society and the many people whose lives have been touched by his teachings.\n—\nOne well-known anecdote from the life of Saint Don Bosco involves a dream he had when he was a young boy. In the dream, he saw a group of boys who were lost and in danger. He tried to lead them to safety, but they kept running away from him.\nAs he chased after the boys, he was joined by a tall, handsome man who told him, “Don’t be afraid. Take these boys under your protection. Educate them, and I will help you.”\nWhen Don Bosco woke up from the dream, he was deeply moved by it and felt called to dedicate his life to the education and care of disadvantaged youth. He saw the dream as a sign from God and took it as a mission to help young people who were lost and in need of guidance.\nThis dream had a profound impact on Don Bosco’s life and shaped the course of his career as an educator. He worked tirelessly to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they needed to succeed, and his innovative teaching methods helped countless boys to achieve their potential.\n—\nOne more anecdote from the life of Saint Don Bosco involves a time when he was working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. There was a young boy named Tony who was particularly difficult to reach and seemed resistant to all of Don Bosco’s efforts to help him.\nDespite this, Don Bosco refused to give up on Tony and continued to try to reach out to him. He eventually discovered that Tony was struggling with a learning disability that made it difficult for him to keep up in school.\nRather than giving up on Tony, Don Bosco worked with him individually and found creative ways to help him learn. He used hands-on activities and practical exercises to engage Tony and help him understand the material.\nThrough his persistence and patience, Don Bosco was able to help Tony overcome his learning disability and succeed in school. This experience was just one example of the compassionate and innovative approach that Don Bosco brought to his work with disadvantaged youth.\n—\nAfter his ordination, Don Bosco began working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. He quickly realized that traditional methods of education were not effective for these boys, who were often uninterested in academics and more interested in practical skills. In response, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture.\nRather than giving up on Tony, Don Bosco worked with him individually and found creative ways to help him learn. He used hands-on activities and practical exercises to engage Tony and help him understand the material.\n—\nUse your hands\nWhat activity did you take up during the pandemic years?\nWas it baking? Gardening? Knitting?\nDid you learn a new instrument? Start working out? Or take up cooking?\nPersonally I picked up woodworking. It was so satisfying to cut and carve wood. Assemble it together and polish it into a finished product.\nMost of the activities that people sought during the pandemic had to do with ‘using your hands.’ We all found solace in physically making something, even from scratch.\n200 years ago, Don Bosco already knew that was true.\nHe’s among the famous saints in the Catholic tradition. Well known for being a teacher, and all the schools he inspired. During his life, he focused on the disadvantaged youth in Turin. He saw that for these troubled children, the usual way of teaching them was not working.\nSo he didn’t force it.\nInstead, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture. (Yep! Getting people to use their hands for work) That helped those struggling youth find work- but spiritually it also helped them relax, and calm down (just like it did for us in the last 3 years)\nHere in the Philippines, this is what we associate Don Bosco with- all the vocational schools and technical skills that a Don Bosco education provided.\nBut I also think we make a big mistake when we think of “Don Bosco”, “Disadvantaged Youth”, “Vocational Training”, and we immediately think “Oh that’s not me.”\nYes, you may not be a disadvantaged youth. Yes, you probably don’t do any vocational work.\nBut just for a minute, exercise your spiritual imagination a little.\nAren’t you disadvantaged, struggling, and troubled?\nI know I am.\nTechnology, media, the news fills me with anxiety\nDo you need to do some manual work?\nI know I do.\nI’m always thinking, thinking, thinking.\nBut when I use my hands and garden, I focus on where I am in that moment. Nothing but what I see and the sensations of my work.\nWork that uses my hands.\nOne of my favorite teaching from John Paul II is about work itself. He says:\n“Since work is always a personal action it follows that the whole person, body and spirit, participates in it, no matter what kind of work it is.”\nWe glamorize the preaching of Jesus, but we forget that he was also a carpenter. Someone who worked with your hands. And anyone who has made anything with their hands will tell you- that the process of creating something. Not rushing. Taking your time. Making mistakes. Learning. This has a holiness all of its own.\nJesus knew this. Don Bosco knew this.

Later, it became a tool for changing my body into something deemed better than the body I had, and that’s when rules came in, assigning moral value to different kinds of foods, calories were obsessively counted, and I got further and further away from connection to my own hunger and full cues and intuitive cravings.\nTo me, a major theme of my last book was that sometimes things that cause short-term boosts can undermine long-term development. But — human intuition being what it is — it’s hard to internalize the idea of a short/long-term tradeoff.\nThat’s interesting because what looks like elite performance is not healthy.\nOr rather what we imagine health to be is the elite performance variety. But there are so many quality of life tradeoffs that are being made when someone wants to be elite in that way.\nThat reminds me of Post Athlete life almost always reverts to mean\nIt’s similar because I remember when I was an athlete, I felt like I was just going to perform and be healthy forever and ever. But of course that’s not true. It’s so hard to imagine in the moment that it isn’t going to last forever, even though you know that conceptually.\nIt’s different because I was never as elite as Lauren Fleshman. Because I didn’t make all the sacrficies. Maybe intuitively I already knew what the tradeoffs were and didn’t want to go there.\nIt’s important because if someone wants to be healthy today, there’s way more that goes into that than just being elite.

It’s akin to a shadow that follows you, regardless of how much light you shine on your work. The key isn’t to eliminate the fear but to get comfortable with it, to make it a part of your creative DNA.\nConsider the journey from a handful of views to millions. The emotional landscape doesn’t shift as dramatically as the numbers do. You might think hitting a milestone will vanquish your fears, but in reality, the fear remains. It’s not about the numbers; it’s about the act of creating itself.\nHere’s a question I often ponder: What’s worse, the fear of creating something that no one sees or the fear of not creating at all? The latter is a silent killer, eroding your potential day by day.\nThis is why practice is non-negotiable. It’s like hiking a trail you’ve never been on before. The first time, every rustle in the bushes makes you jump. But as you walk it again and again, you become familiar with the sounds, the terrain, and even your own internal rhythms of fear and excitement. You never stop being cautious, but you do stop being paralyzed.\nRemember, if you’re not creating because you’re scared, you’re not getting used to the fear. You’re letting it win. So, the next time fear whispers in your ear, acknowledge it, thank it for its concern, and then proceed to do the work anyway. Because the work is where you grow, and growth is where you find your freedom.\nThis matters to me because I’ve felt the weight of this fear, and I know I’m not alone. Even seasoned professionals feel it. The difference is, they’ve made peace with it. And so can I, through consistent practice.\n\nRead more at: How to Get Over the Fear of Creating Things\nGo one level up : Creator Economy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Writing helps you be creative"},"Notes/Embracing-the-Art-of-\"Showing-Up\"-in-the-World-of-Entrepreneurship":{"title":"Embracing the Art of \"Showing Up\" in the World of Entrepreneurship","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","Notes/The-High-Income-Skills-Symphony-in-Modern-Entrepreneurship"],"tags":["entrepreneurship","finance","resilience","opportunities"],"content":"In the world of entrepreneurship, one valuable strategy stands out—a relentless commitment to “showing up.” This slow grind approach is not about instant results but a steady accumulation of effort, akin to a marathon rather than a sprint.\nAs an entrepreneur, the transition away from the security of a bi-monthly paycheck can be nerve-wracking. The volatility of net worth in this new landscape is undeniable. Surprisingly, even during the highs and lows of financial life, the worry about money remains a constant companion. It becomes clear that financial anxiety is often independent of the actual balance in one’s bank account once basic needs are met.\nDespite the hardships, there’s an essential truth to grasp here. If you consistently show up, deliver value, exhibit decency, and apply your intellect, opportunities have a way of gravitating towards you. It’s not an immediate solution but a path that demands resilience and unwavering commitment.\nThe journey may be tough and stressful, but it’s in the persistence and continuous presence that the seeds of success are sown.\n\nRead more at: Life after “Golden Handcuffs” | RadReads\nGo one level up : Entrepreneurship MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The High-Income Skills Symphony in Modern Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/Emergence-(defn)":{"title":"Emergence (defn)","links":["Notes/Idea-Emergence-(defn)","tags/on/systems"],"tags":["on/systems"],"content":"up:: Idea Emergence (defn)\ntags::#on/systems\nEmergence (defn) §\nEmergence refers to the existence or formation of collective behaviors — what parts of a system do together that they would not do alone.\nTo quickly understand this amazing concept, I try to dumb it down and say “Emergence is adding complexity.” Or “Emergence is when the new whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”\nIf I was alone in a room, but now I am talking with friends, we are at a higher level of complexity.\n\nMe alone equals Emergence Level 1\nMe with friends equals Emergence Level 2\n"},"Notes/Emergency-reserves-lets-you-push":{"title":"Emergency reserves lets you push","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Emergency reserves lets you push §\nBetter than an easy goal\nTo me this means you have some extra energy in case things get tough\nOr you want to give yourself a little bit more"},"Notes/Emerson-Creative-Spark-and-Oversoul-and-Inculturation":{"title":"Emerson Creative Spark and Oversoul and Inculturation","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/on/creativity","tags/on/creation","tags/on/nature","tags/inculturation"],"tags":["idea-note","on/creativity","on/creation","on/nature","inculturation"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#on/creativity#on/creation#on/nature#inculturation\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/627b0efb1239922546f6bf09\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nIdeas that you start to form when you get in touch with nature\nThe differences come from the creative spark\nand interacts with different circumstances\nAccounts for apparent differences\nSee also §"},"Notes/Emil-Zatopek-and-his-breath-holding-technique-(example)":{"title":"Emil Zatopek and his breath holding technique (example)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Emil Zatopek and his breath holding technique (example) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey ideas §\n\n\nI remember reading about Zatopek, and his insane (triple?)\n\nHe won the 5k, the 10k, and the marathon\n\n\n\nIn the 2021 Olympics Safan has done something similar\n\nShe won the 5k and 10k; and the bronzed in the 1500m\n\n\n"},"Notes/Emotional-intelligence-has-more-to-do-with-trusting-our-gut":{"title":"Emotional intelligence has more to do with trusting our gut","links":["Notes/Self-1-and-Self-2-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"Emotional intelligence has more to do with trusting our gut §\nSo a bit of a myth about how in touch with your emotions you are.\nSelf 2 in\nSelf 1 and Self 2 (concept)\nNon verbal\nThey are aware\nIn touch with their internal states\nCan articulate them\nJohn Mayer and Peter Salovey\n1990 paper\nhttps://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.2190/DUGG-P24E-52WK-6CDG"},"Notes/Empathetic-Response":{"title":"Empathetic Response","links":["Notes/Deploy-Empathy-+-Kevon's-Be-a-Dummy"],"tags":["-on/empathy-script-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nDeploy Empathy\nMichele Hansen\nurl: https://readwise.io/bookreview/16925964\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nA sample empathetic response\nAn empathetic response would have been “It sounds like you’re having a hard time,” which makes the person feel heard.\nSee also §\nDeploy Empathy + Kevon’s Be a Dummy"},"Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)":{"title":"Energy (re Flow)","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/flow","Notes/Direction-(re-Flow)","Poor-Diet","Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)","Notes/Enthusiasm-(re-Flow)"],"tags":["flow"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#flow\nAttention is what the mind is focused on—and what it has been focused on over the recent past (the past 72 hours is simple way to look at it).

O2 levels increase. CO2 levels decrease. pH levels increase (and surprisingly stay higher than what’s normal even after breath-holding, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe they are associated with pH drops.\nO2:CO2 Ratio &amp; pH Levels:\n\nA normal ratio is 4:1 &amp; pH: 7.40\nDuring hyperventilation, the ratio goes up to 11:1 &amp; pH: 7.70\nDuring hypoventilation, the ratio goes down to 1:1 &amp; pH: 7.50\n\nInteresting note: Even after breath-holding, pH levels stay surprisingly higher than normal, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe the detriments that are talked about are always associated with drops in pH. Hence, if pH stays above normal, all should be good. I’d love to get some expert opinions on this.\n\nResearch Link\n\nLactate Levels:\n\nA normal range is 0.5 - 1.5 mmol/L. The test subject’s baseline was 0.70.\nDuring hyperventilation, it only increased to 1.15 mmol/L.\nDuring hypoventilation, it lowered to 0.90 mmol/L.\n\nFor comparison a 15-45 second sprint shows lactate levels rising way up to 8-15 mmol/L. So, there is no worry for the minuscule rise in lactate levels from hyper-hypoventilation.\n\nResearch Link\n\nBenefit # 1: POSITIVE HORMONAL RESPONSE AND A (SUPPOSED) INCREASED IMMUNE SYSTEM. §\nThis act stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline (just like taking a cold shower, which also forces us to hyperventilate a bit), and has been shown to benefit the immune system.\nBenefit # 2: MINDFULNESS §\nBoth conscious “over-breathing” and the conscious breath-holding act as a fast and simple form of mindfulness for me, getting me out of racing thoughts in the prefrontal cortex, and—due to the hormonal release—allowing my brain stem and more primitive parts of the brain (such as the pituitary gland) to activate without invoking worry and stress (I admit things get unclear for me here, so I’d like to hear more on this). Regardless, I’m more calm, centered, and clear-minded afterwards.\nBenefit # 3: EUPHORIC FEELING §\nBreathing in excess O2 leads to tingling fingers and lightheadedness. It also creates a slightly euphoric feeling. Is that weird?\nPART 2 §\nThen after elevating my O2 levels, that’s when I hold my breath, which I imagine completely moves the O2:CO2 ratio in the opposite relationship — like a seesaw. And in the process, it leads to:\nBenefit # 4: WILLPOWER BOOST §\nIt gives a sense of control. And my belief is that a SENSE of control is a main factor in willpower and happiness. (Whether or not we really have any real control is a separate debate.) Since this odd activity increases my sense of control, it increases my sense of happiness.\nBenefit # 5: ANTI-FRAGILITY §\nStressing the mind and body (safely) leads to the overcompensation effect. That’s why we adapt to heavy weights by getting stronger (to throw out a common example).\nMajor Concern §\nDoes this pattern of Hyperventilation/Retention cause any harm? There are a few studies covering Wim Hof and his method that show clear results (see below), but much more research is needed.\nAnybody have other takes, insights, research, commentary, or suggestions on this?\nResearch Link : http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full\n\nNote on Lactate Levels\nLactic acid is a product of cell metabolism that can accumulate when cells lack sufficient oxygen (hypoxia) and must turn to a less efficient means of energy production, or when a condition causes excess production or impaired clearance of lactate.\nDepending on pH, it is sometimes present in the form of lactic acid. However, with the neutral pH maintained by the body, most lactic acid will be present in the blood as lactate.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2015-12-03\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Expose-and-adapt-vs-Correct-and-Protect":{"title":" Expose and adapt vs Correct and Protect ","links":["Notes/Antifragility","Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/How-to-be-more-confident-in-your-injury-recovery--and-why-being-confident-makes-a-big-difference"],"tags":["-expose-","-injury-","-recovery-","-adapting-"],"content":"I like this idea,\nI’ve been applying it to my own training\nit’s contrasted with correct and protect\nSomething that’s stronger once it’s been broken\nLink this to Antifragility\nWhat is it? §\nThat if you want to deal with pain, one strategy is to expose yourself to some new movements.\nThis way your body doesn’t have any fear associated with moving.\nThe body can adapt to many things.\nYou can trust your own body to get better.\nWhy is it important? §\nBecause we’re always dealing with pain in one way shape or form.\nAt least here, it means you don’t have to just hide\n\nRead more at: Podcast With Greg Lehman — BETTER MOVEMENT\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: How to be more confident in your injury recovery- and why being confident makes a big difference"},"Notes/External-cues-vs-Internal-cues":{"title":"External cues vs Internal cues","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"External cues vs Internal cues §\nIt’s generally accepted that external cues work better than internal cues\ntry to find external cues\nBecause you can’t really describe what is in the body so well?\nIsrael Halperin\nBetter movement podcast"},"Notes/External-vs-Internal-Attentional-Focus":{"title":"External vs Internal Attentional Focus","links":["Inner-Game-of-Tennis","Self-2","Visualizing-an-Outcome","Motor-Control-and-Learning:-A-Behavioral-Emphasis","Gabriele-Wulf"],"tags":[],"content":"Internal Focus and External Focus §\nContext §\nThis is about learning and how to develop new skills\nWhat is it §\nInternal focus\n\nYou focus on your own body.

It might seem like these situations only arise in rare, crucial moments. But Phil Knight’s choice to face his fear is just a larger-than life version of a choice you make all the time.\nNote: What am I afraid of, and what am I avoiding? What causes me fear and anxiety? Can I practice facing that properly?\nThe practice of exposure follows from what we already know about fear: the best way to get over fear is to face it. But it turns out that not all exposure is created equal—there are ways to effectively optimize your exposure so that you can maximize your chances for actually reducing your fear and making sure it doesn’t come back.\nNote: Keep exposing yourself to scary situations- but do it in an optimal, planned out, and reflective way.\nRather than aiming for fear reduction, exposures should aim for surprise.\nNote: This is counterintuitive and powerful. Instead of being outcome based, practice being open to surprises!\nIn my experience, it’s that willingness that makes the key difference. When I’m truly willing to feel the emotion, whatever was troubling me feels a little bit less imminent, and a little bit less sticky than it did before—and I’m able to move through it more fluidly.\nNote: This is general advice on how to approach an exposure experience.\n\nRead more at: Fear, Courage, and Willingness - Superorganizers - Every\nGo one level up : Health Mindsets MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Change is Hard, don’t pretend it isn’t"},"Notes/Fail-fast-and-fail-forward":{"title":"Fail fast and fail forward","links":["Failure-is-an-option!-Designing-your-fitness-life-(Blog-Post)"],"tags":[],"content":"Fail fast and fail forward §\nFailure is an option!

healthy.\nWe put all our money and investment on remedies\n(hospitals, medicine)\nand not enough on prevention and healthy lifestyles\nBut arguably that’s a bigger part of healthcare than the medicine and the hospitalization.\nIn a sense you wouldn’t be needing that latter bit as much if you had a stronger system of healthcare in place\nCan you imagine getting a gym membership from your health insurance?\nOr living and working in a place where they provide dental, ER, but also gym allocation?\nSome kind of system where you’re properly incentivized to work on your health in a simple

checks you up.\nThey see that you’re spine is slightly out of alignment\nThey can give you some medicine to help you with the pain now.\nBut they don’t want to recommend surgery because it’s not absolutely necessary.\nSo they say, you should consider doing the following exercises:\n\nsome stretching\nsome weights\netc\n\nAnd then they set you off.\nNow what?\nYou’re kinda stuck.\nIf they have a partnered facility.\nThen you can do some physical therapy there.\nAnd that will help give you some ideas\nBut at some point you get stuck\nBecause the system dropped out\nSo a fitness coach\n(apart from being a motivator)\nWill help you set up a system\nSo that you can continue to do things\neven when the circumstances change na.\nJames Clear Quote\nWe fall to the level of our systems\nWhy is this important §\nBecause we’re starting to understand more the importance of systemic health\nNot one time interventions\nThe Place of medicine and breathing (Quote)\nThere’s the one time big time

However he came about plotting the two variables against each, it’s a landmark discovery. It’s a lodestar to which I keep returning. It’s the foundation much of my thinking and to my carving of that theory to practical, moment-to-moment application.\n\nLater on, Dr. Mihaly used this version to show the different states of mind plotted on the map of Challenge vs Skill.\n\nWhat is my Contribution to Flow Theory? §\nMy contribution to Flow Theory is just to expand on using the Flow Map as a practical tool to adjust one’s state of mind as needed—usually to create the Conditions of Flow (FlowCreation Theory).\nBasically, Mihaly’s Flow Map can be used many times a day as a simple tool to identify one’s current state of mind. That’s the easy part.\nThe second part is all about how to take that knowledge to improve one’s state of mind—ideally by getting closer to a feeling of a high quality experience—what Mihaly calls “optimal experience,” which is none other than Flow.\nSo you can use the Flow Map as a “State of Mind” Map—a useful guide to manage your state of mind from moment to moment.\n\nFind your current state of mind—Maybe ask, “What am I feeling?” or “Where’s my head at?”\nCreate the Conditions of Flow—This is where we can develop some FlowCreation Theory skills and tactics.\n\nSay, someone is anxious: they can point to “Anxiety” on the Flow Map and then have a few ideas how to get closer to “Optimal Experience” (Flow).

Here is an example of each:\n\n“I’m Anxious, I’m feeling confused.” Do I know what to focus on right now? Am I doing the thing I should be doing right now? If this is the issue, then my Direction isn’t solid. How can I improve my clarity about what to do? How can I reduce the amount of competing actions to take?\n“I’m Anxious, my mind is scattered.” What’s my environment like; am I getting interrupted too much? If so, then my Attention is suffering. How can I reduce the intensity and frequency of these distractions?\n“I’m not excited about anything, I’m apathetic.” I need to reconnect to some Enthusiasm. What gets me excited or motivated? How can I reconnect with that?\n“I’m tired, I have a headache, everything feels like too much.” Why are my Energy levels down? What needs to be improved out of the following: quality of sleep, diet, exercise, leisure time, and/or relationships?\n\nFour Factors of Flow §\nI have found that using the Flow Map to find your current State of Mind is a valuable exercise to improving it. Equally valuable is using it to find any glaring weaknesses in the elements that help create a good State of Mind. I have found that there are essentially Four Factors of Flow. They are: Direction (re Flow), Attention (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow), and Energy (re Flow). The best way to improve your experience is to identify what you’re lacking, and then taking actions to strengthen that area."},"Notes/Flowers-leaves-or-roots-(Blog-Draft)":{"title":"Flowers leaves or roots (Blog Draft)","links":["Notes/The-timing-of-festivals-and-dictating-seasons","How-plants-direct-their-energy"],"tags":[],"content":"Flowers, leaves, or roots (Blog Draft) §\nSource §\n\n??\nAs a note, I can’t find single sources for a lot of the homesteading things\n\nKey Idea §\nWhen growing plants you have to choose among these things\nWhen we got our new calamansi plant, it was already starting to have a few fruits on it.

When we talk about fluid frameworks in the “Linking Your Thinking” System, we’re mainly referring to higher-order notes like MOCs and the Home note (but a balanced use of MOCs, folders, tags, and queries can also maintain a fluid structure).\nFluid frameworks are not mutually exclusive. That means a note with its link in an MOC, doesn’t exclusively live in the MOC note. A note can live and link freely. A note can be discovered in as many places as it’s referenced. These are the fundamentals of linking notes together.\nNow with higher-order notes like MOCs, we can fluidly add any structure, at any time. But these frameworks offer unique attributes to allow us to work more fluidly than ever before.\nFluid Frameworks vs Rigid Frameworks §\nWow…So a fluid framework is a non-essential supporting structure.\nWhereas, a typical framework—like a folder—is an essential supporting structure. Delete the folder, and you delete the files within.\nAnd that’s because folders are not fluid; they are a rigid framework. They reduce the number of ways you have to access the notes trapped within. Now it’s worth noting, we do have Global Search, and we can link to notes within folders…so that’s better than it used to be…but there is still no removing the friction that comes from having to twirl down folders X, Y, and Z, just to get to Idea Omega.)\nSo even though folders alone are rigid, if you expertly use Fluid Frameworks—i.e. HIGHER-ORDER NOTES—to support your linked knowledge, then you can also work back in some smart applications of folders.\nThat’s why we’re here: to become skilled and confident with how we are deploying the tools that we have to structure our notes in the best way possible.\n\n\nSee the inspiration for using the term “fluid” at Fluid Taxonomies.\nFor more see: Benefits of LYT frameworks\n"},"Notes/Fluid-Taxonomies":{"title":"Fluid Taxonomies","links":["Notes/LYT-Kit","tags/pkm","Steen-Comer","tags/source/quote","Notes/Fluid-Frameworks"],"tags":["pkm","source/quote"],"content":"up:: LYT Kit\ntags::#pkm\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nSome content and links have been removed.\n\n\nFluid Taxonomies §\nFluid Taxonomies is a term coined by Steen Comer, which came up in our conversations about MOCs and other ways of managing knowledge.\nSteen wrote:\n\nFluid Taxonomies\nThe notion that in a loosely-ordered system like a ZK, you can apply taxonomies in an on again, off again way, and not be beholden to any of them for longer than they are useful.\n\n[These taxonomies] are useful abstractions, ways of arranging information to provide paths for specific purposes.\nAll of them have advantages and disadvantages. Most notably, all of them fail to give you the serendipity of search that most [zettlekasten] options traditionally have. Which is fine, depending on what you’re trying to do.\nMake sure you keep in mind that whatever taxonomy you’re using is not True, it’s just a tool.\nIt occurs to me, another way of thinking about this is that you’re applying hierarchies, like a file system directory tree, but they’re being applied in such a way that does not limit the data to staying in those hierarchies.\n[Consider] the metaphor of a functioning collective. You put a hierarchy in place (like an MOC), for as long as it’s useful. And then when it’s not useful, the members of that hierarchy rearrange their power structure to suit the new purpose.\nThen to summarize the conversation, Steen riffed on the Discordian quote:\n\n“All models are True in some sense, False in some sense, and Meaningless in some sense”#source/quote\n\nSteen is one of those people who makes you think.

(As we talked about last time)\nBut one thing that injury does give is the chance to ask a very important question to yourself:\nAnd that question is “Why would I care to get back into action?” \nIt sounds like an obvious question- but diving into it may reveal something to you. It can help you understand your mindset when it comes to injury, recovery, and what you value.\n“Why does movement matter to you?”\nMaybe you love the way it makes you feel. The way it boosts your energy levels, or the way it helped you stay fit and healthy. \nMaybe you love the goal setting. You love performing well and hitting your targets. You love reaching new heights.\nMaybe it matters for you to stay healthy for your family. Or the people in your life who rely on you.\nIf you have kids, maybe they need you to be healthy and active so you can chase them around and play with them. \nIf you have a partner, they may appreciate having an active partner to share activities with. \nAnd if you have friends who love to exercise, they’re probably missing your company on their runs or hikes.\nRemembering that there are people in your life who want you to be active can be a strong incentive to get moving again. \n//\nIn 2008, when tore my ACL, I was at the peak of my game. I was one of the best college track and field athletes in the country.\nMy injury was bad luck, but I had tasted being one of the best. I wanted to do everything I could do to get back to the top.\nSo I saw the doctors, I did the exercises, I trained hard to get back into things.\nThen in 2010 I tore my other ACL.\nThis time it was different. I was nearing the end of my college career. I was thinking about doing other things apart from sports. I didn’t care anymore about staying at the top of my performance.\nSo I went through the process of recovery, like last time.\nBut to be honest with you, moving and exercising was never the same again.\nMy whole life, I found meaning to exercise through competition. I wanted to beat my competitors, and I wanted to be the best.\nWhen that went away after my 2nd big injury, I couldn’t find anything that made me want to move and exercise anymore.\n//\nI lived with that struggle for 10 years.\nI had no idea what kind of exercise I wanted to do. Especially since I didn’t want to get injured again. There was too much frustration.\nNo matter how careful you are, or how much you prepare, there’s always the chance you’ll get injured. \nIt’s the reality of life. \nI don’t know anyone who has gone through their entire life without any kind of injury at all.\nIt’s impossible.\nIn the journey to finding movement again- and movement that is meaningful, there are a few ways of thinking that I find valuable.\n\nWhat movement makes it worth it?\nWhat movement feels like play?\nWhat movements do I want to explore?\n\n//\nWhat movements make it worth it?\nWhen it comes to figuring out what you want to do, it can be a tough journey. And people who have a sport they’re passionate about are very lucky\nRecently, I have started asking the question, “If I will continue to have some form of pain, what are the movements that I really care about, and would be worth working through my injury problems for”\nIf I have anxieties about injury and pain- so what activities can I do that would make it worthwhile for me? \nI have to choose something I love, so that if I get hurt and injured, I’ll find a way to keep growing and exploring.\nThese are very personal, and different for each of us.\nFor me, there is nothing I love more than when I’m hiking in the forest. And I would love to keep healthy and fit to be able to hike throughout my life.\nI have worked with someone who loves scuba diving, and her purpose in staying active and healthy is for that. Even when she has an injury or a setback, she’s eager to recover for her love of scuba diving.\nFor some, meaningful movement is biking and playing at the park with their kids. For some meaningful movement is finishing a marathon. There are so many possibilities for meaningful movement.\n//\nWhat feels like play?\nIt’s no secret that I’m a big fan of play. \nKids play all the time. They make up games and move around. But we forget how to play when we become adults. \nThis doesn’t mean you go back to your childhood games.\nIt’s more about asking:\n\nWhat are movements that let me explore?\nWhat are movements that let me be creative?\nWhat are movements that I find fun?\n\nInstead of thinking of play as a waste of time, think of play as something that is essential to our well being. It makes us more open and more creative.\nAfter all, even as adults, we still want to stay connected to our sense of wonder and our capacity for joy.\n//\nFind the fun\nHowever, there is one factor that I believe is more important than any other when it comes to choosing an exercise routine: the “fun factor.”\nYour chances of sticking to an exercise program are much higher if you choose something that you actually enjoy.\nIf you hate running, there’s no point in forcing yourself to go for a run every day. \nBut if you enjoy hiking, then make that a part of your routine. \nOr if you like playing in the playground, see if you can find a way to incorporate that into your workout.\nThe bottom line is that you should try to find an activity that feels like play rather than work. When you enjoy yourself, it’s much easier to stick with it.\nSo next time you’re wondering what exercise you should do, ask yourself this question: “What feels like play to me?” And then go do that.\n//\nA chance to explore\nFinally, getting injured, and being stuck in an injury mindset led down the path of exploring what it is that I love to do. It took me 10 years to break out of that mindset! (I don’t want it to take so long for you)\nSometimes, an injury can give you a chance to ask new questions and explore new things.\nThe best thing you can do is to be mentally flexible and adapt. If things don’t happen as you plan, try taking a different path.\nIt’s not always easy, but it’s important to lead you to discover the movement that is meaningful for you.\n//\nIn the end you have to find your WHY\nWhat is that thing that motivates you to keep on going forward\nMaybe it’s the sense of camaraderie you feel with your teammates. \nOr the feeling of accomplishment you get when you finally complete that difficult workout. \nOr maybe the vision of your kids and grandkids playing with you on the floor\nWhatever it is, finding that deeper meaning will help you stay motivated and focused on your recovery.\nThe road to recovery can be long and difficult. But it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. There are many others who have been in your shoes and come out the other side. Reach out to them for support and advice.

If you’re in Flow, it’s because these factors are doing well. If you are not in flow, then at least one factor isn’t doing well.\n\nMain Factors Governing the Strength of Each §\n\nDirection (re Flow) — Level of Clarity; Amount of Directions — Aside from “Nature &amp; Nurture” (which is a philosophical rabbit hole), it’s the Level of Clarity and Amount of Directions (i.e. the number of goals one has) that most govern the strength of Direction.\nAttention (re Flow) — Distractions in both Frequency and Intensity — This is most governed by Distractions: the Intensity of Distractions and the Frequency of Distractions.\nEnthusiasm (re Flow) — Level of Desire — This also ties into “Nature &amp; Nurture” a bit. It might sound circular, but one’s Level of Desire dictates one’s Enthusiasm. It’s the most intangible. What excites somebody? What inspires them, motivates them, fills them with passion? I’m not sure how to best affect one’s Enthusiasm. It’s the “Why” in the world of “Goal Setting.” It’s very personal to each person, but some commonalities are usually: to be stimulated and engaged, to feel important, to feel the work is important, to improve one’s financial situation.\nEnergy (re Flow) — Quality of Sleep, Diet, &amp; Exercise; Quality of Relationships &amp; Community; Quality of Leisure Time — also Hydration, Sunlight, Nature, Hobbies, etc.\n\nHow They Impact Each Other §\n\nIf Direction is clear and not diluted, then it’s easier to focus one’s Attention; Enthusiasm isn’t diluted; Energy isn’t wasted.\nIf Attention isn’t spread too thin amid myriad distractions, then it’s easier to stay on target in the ideal Direction; Enthusiasm isn’t diluted; Energy isn’t wasted.\nIf Enthusiasm is strong, then it’s easier to stay committed to one’s Direction; it’s easier to maintain one’s Attention; it’s easier to compensate for middling Energy levels.\nIf Energy is cultivated, then your Direction seems possible/doable/easier; You can more easily maintain your Attention; you can get work done even when you’re not feeling Enthusiasm (and through the process of doing the work, you can usually create new Enthusiasm).\n\nIf you have a Poor Diet (not included in the LYT Kit), then your Attention is going to suck: you’ll be more easily distracted; so you’ll spend time in other Directions; and thus you’ll dilute and dissipate your Enthusiasm. This one is a huge component that you can control. You can replace “Poor Diet” with “Lack of Sleep” and you’ll get similar results.\n\n\n"},"Notes/Four-Great-Chinese-Novels":{"title":"Four Great Chinese Novels","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nThe four great Chinese novels are:\n\nMonkey King (Journey to the West) by Wu Cheng’en\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong\nWater Margin by Shi Nai’an\nDream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin\n\nSee also §"},"Notes/Four-preferences-when-doing-business":{"title":"Four preferences when doing business","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Four preferences when doing business §\nVisual\nEmotional\nFunctional\nFinancial\nSource\nE-myth business"},"Notes/Foxes-and-hedgehogs-(analogy)":{"title":"Foxes and hedgehogs (analogy)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Foxes and hedgehogs (analogy) §\nQuote Greek poet Archilochus\nThe fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing\nHeck if I know what this means\nBut neither is good or bad.\nThey just have specific skills"},"Notes/Frame-of-Reference-(concept)":{"title":"Frame of Reference (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Frame of Reference (concept) §\nIn Physics, this is all about having a clear sense of what you’re basing things on.\n(Physics but also in humanities)\nIt’s this idea of you see based on where you are."},"Notes/Framing-by-Dysfunctional-belief":{"title":"Framing by Dysfunctional belief","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Framing by Dysfunctional belief §\nContext §\nIn the book desingning your life.\nThey tell a story\nand then talk about how that anecdote\nmanifests a dysfunctional belief\nthat is hurting us\nIn Psychology? §\nIs this just called reframing?\nWhat’s a good way to talk about this?\nTo show what it is"},"Notes/Framing":{"title":"Framing","links":["Notes/Priming","tags/concept"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"X:: Priming\ntags::#concept\nFraming §\nI’m the hidden 500 pound gorilla that underpins all human communication.\nIf you hear, “this doesn’t cost 1000,itonlycosts50!” That sounds great because it’s been framed in context to 1000.Buteven50 is a lot for a cup of coffee.\nThis is related to “moving the goalposts” and other cognitive biases (not included in the LYT Kit)\nWiki §\nThe Framing Effect: People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.

And so when when you’re a novice and you look at a problem it’s simplistic. I can solve world hunger, I can do this and then as you dive in it’s really freaking complicated right?

It can feel like something that is completely out of your control, and that can be frustrating and overwhelming.\nResearch has shown that certain genes can make some people more susceptible to chronic pain, which can make it a more persistent and severe problem for them. However, it’s important to note that while these genetic predispositions may play a role in chronic pain, they do not necessarily determine whether or not a person will experience it.\nAdditionally, it’s worth mentioning that while researchers have been able to identify genes that predispose people to chronic pain, they have not yet found any genes that increase the risk for acute back pain.\nThis suggests that the causes of acute back pain may be different from those of chronic pain and may be related more to lifestyle and environmental factors.\nThat’s interesting because chronic pain is so misunderstood and it’s hard to decide the best way to navigate it\nThat reminds me that I can’t always control everything. If I’m predisposed to chronic pain I have to accept that part of it. This note is also related to To Predict Chronic Pain Look at the Brain\nIt’s similar because because there’s so much we have yet to understand.

The idea is to continually increase the amount of weight or resistance to stimulate muscle growth or strength gains. But what if we flip the script? Enter “Greasing the Groove,” a strategy that focuses on volume through sub-maximal sets.\nThe beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and adaptability. Instead of pushing for the hardest possible reps each time, you focus on quality reps that are less taxing. This allows for more sets and, consequently, a higher total volume of work. It’s akin to a writer focusing on writing 200 good words every day rather than aiming for a perfect essay in one sitting. Over time, those 200 words add up to a substantial body of work.\nFor someone like me, who finds most exercise routines boring, this approach can be a game-changer. It allows for more frequent engagement with the activity, making it easier to integrate into daily life. It’s not about the grand gestures of lifting the heaviest weight; it’s about the consistent, smaller actions that accumulate into significant results.\nHowever, it’s crucial to remember that “Greasing the Groove” is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. It’s a tool in the toolbox, useful for specific goals like increasing pull-up numbers or improving technique. It’s not necessarily the go-to for hypertrophy or maximal strength gains.\n\nRead more at: Playing with Strength - Sam Sager’s Blog\nGo one level up : Movement MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Find your reps"},"Notes/Greasing-the-Groove":{"title":"Greasing the Groove","links":[],"tags":["-movement-on/movement-hacks-movement--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nthelonggame.xyz\nThe Long Game 108: Push-Ups Pull-Ups &amp; Greasing the Groove, Raising Others’ Expectations, Terrapunk Manifesto\nurl: https://thelonggame.xyz/p/the-long-game-108-push-ups-pull-ups\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\n“Greasing the Groove” is a method popularized by Russian fitness instructor Pavel Tsatsouline.

Then, when we repeat that same action, it  miraculously requires less effort. How can this be?!\nIt’s because Nature’s Selfish Gene has a prime directive to survive—which means to become more efficient—so whatever you do once, is easier to do a second time.\nBy making a repeated action more efficient, less energy is used, less willpower is required1, and fewer calories are burned—all of which lead to a better chance of survival.\nBad habits and good habits are nothing more than a bunch of self-perpetuating Feedback Loops that have grown efficient over time, with deeply enmeshed neural connections. In this way, “Passing mental states become lasting neural traits”.2\nTo quit a bad habit, don’t try to stop it like Superman; you’ll fail. Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia in the form of built-up neural efficiencies in the brain (see Cobwebs into Cables). Instead, try to co-opt it by shifting the tracks. See Changing a habit is really about replacing a routine.\n\nWhile “habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage”, it doesn’t necessarily form in the ways you might think—meaning, your “self” optimizes for what you repeat, regardless of whether or not it’s “good” for you.\nTransclude of block 309fcc\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2020-05-29\ncreated:: 2020-05-29\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes §\n\n\nWhen it comes to willpower expenditure, the anterior cingulate cortex, is a crucial player. ↩\n\n\nQuote by Hebb’s Rule ↩\n\n\n"},"Notes/Habits-are-all-about-identity-change":{"title":"Habits are all about identity change","links":["Atomic-Habits","James-Clear"],"tags":[],"content":"Habits are all about Identity Change §\nSource §\n\nAtomic Habits by James Clear\n\nKey idea §\n\nIdentity change: It’s not about how or what\n\nIt’s all about who\n\n\n\nYou become your habits\nThis is very\nVirtue ethics\nAristotle"},"Notes/Habits-carry-a-ton-of-hidden-inertia":{"title":" Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia ","links":["Notes/Feedback-Loop","Flywheel-Effect","Frankenstein-Monster","Pace-Layers","Notes/Like-begets-like","Maps/Habits-MOC"],"tags":["-habit-"],"content":"While some Feedback Loops show immediate results, many times progress is hidden until much further along in time.

The law posits two routes to conquering inertia: either make the pain of inaction greater than the pain of action, or make the pleasure of action surpass the pleasure of inaction.\nIn the context of health, this is a game-changer. We often think of motivation as an internal force, something we either have or don’t. But what if we could externalize it? What if we could design our environment in such a way that it nudges us toward the behaviors we desire?\nConsider the gym-goer who places their workout clothes next to their bed the night before. This simple act reduces the friction of getting started, making the “pain of action” less daunting. On the flip side, imagine filling your home with only healthy snacks. The “pleasure of action” (eating well) suddenly becomes easier to achieve than the “pleasure of inaction” (indulging in junk food).\nBut here’s where it gets personal for me: I’ve always found most exercise to be dreadfully boring. So, I’ve had to get creative with my environment to make the “pleasure of action” outweigh the “pleasure of inaction.” For instance, I’ve combined workouts with activities I enjoy, like listening to podcasts or audiobooks. This way, the pleasure of action isn’t just about the exercise; it’s about the entire experience.\nThe key takeaway? Don’t underestimate the power of your environment. It’s not just about willpower; it’s about setting up your surroundings to make the right choices the easy ones.

Step on the scale every day and own it.\nThat’s interesting because you have to measure something. And though people say you shouldn’t just rely on the scale, if your weight is the metric you care about (for now) then you should 100% track it\nThat reminds me of the quote, “what is not measured is not managed” it’s almost important to balance these things.\nIt’s similar because if we want to make progress we do need some real numbers there to really put it into perspecdtive\nIt’s different because sometimes, we can get caught up in the measuring.

The system and process. Yep, makes me this of my ode to The Process, see Trust the process (kit).\nHabits are the fundamental unit of your systems. Your current systems are perfectly designed to provide you with your current results.\n\nJames adds a fourth step to Duhigg’s habit cycle, which was needed. James is a smart dude. Check out the steps here: Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues.\nOther tidbits:\n\nThe first step is Awareness. Discover and record your habits throughout the day. Here’s an example of me Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013\n\nThe more specific the implementation, the more motivation, ie time, place, etc\n\n\nFocus on Identity over Outcome: ie “I’m the guy who…” over thinking about the result I want…Every action you take is you casting a vote for your identity.\nJames shares ‘The Goldilocks rule’, which is nothing more than finding Flow through balancing challenge with ability, which apparently is 3-4% beyond your current ability. You need victories to stay satisfied, but you need to be challenged.\n\n\n“Men desire novelty to such a degree that men who are doing well require it just as much as men who are not.”\n\nAh yes, “novelty”. Reminds me of how Our brain’s attentional filter responds to Importance and Novelty.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2019-10-01\ncreated:: 2019-10-01\nmodified:: 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/How-Crossfit-Acts-Like-a-Religion":{"title":" How Crossfit Acts Like a Religion ","links":["Notes/202202030902--Find-a-group-where-your-desired-culture-exists","Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/202201252136--Health,-Culture,-and-National-security"],"tags":["-health-","-community-"],"content":"The rise of CrossFit as a non-religious community functioning in ways that resemble religion is a fascinating phenomenon that reflects broader societal trends.\nWith the decline of traditional religious institutions and the increasing number of people identifying as religiously unaffiliated, many people are seeking out alternative communities to fill the void left by the decline of organized religion.\nCrossFit provides a sense of community, shared values, and rituals that are reminiscent of religious practices. These activities create a sense of belonging and shared purpose, much like what one might find in a religious community.\nHowever, there are also concerns about the ways in which these non-religious communities can function in ways that are exclusive or harmful.\nCrossFit, for example, has been criticized for promoting an unhealthy and dangerous culture of extreme exercise and body shaming.\nAdditionally, the sense of community and shared purpose that these communities provide can also lead to insularity and the exclusion of outsiders.\nAs society continues to change and evolve, it is important to consider the ways in which non-religious communities can function in positive and negative ways, and to work towards creating inclusive and welcoming spaces for all individuals.\nThat’s interesting because if we care about getting people healthy, thinking about it from a structural and societal level is where we can make really big impacts.\nWill power is way overrated, and designing your environment is 10x more effective.\nThat reminds me of 202202030902- Find a group where your desired culture exists.\nIt’s similar because if you want to make some kind of positive (or negative) change in yourself, then surround yourself with a group where that behavior is already manifested.

According to Wapnick, people who lean more toward multipotentiality crave three things from their career and life: variety, meaning, and money. To help multipotentialites find the right path, Wapnick has outlined four ways to find jobs that can help you achieve this.\nThe first is the “Group hug” approach, which involves having one job that lets you do many different things you are interested in.\nThe second is the “Slash approach,” where you combine two or more part-time jobs, often in fairly niche careers.\nThe third is the “Einstein approach,” where you find a job that you don’t mind doing to pay the bills, but which also leaves you enough time and energy to pursue other passions on the side.\nThe last approach is the “Phoenix approach,” where you pursue one job or career trajectory with a healthy dose of obsession for a while, then quit and start over in another field.\nBy considering these approaches, multipotentialites can find a career or life trajectory that brings them fulfillment, variety, meaning, and money.\nThat’s interesting because I have always identified as someone who is incredibly multidisciplinary. But I’ve struggled to turn that into a career\nThat reminds me of David Epstein’s book Range- a simple book with a pretty good concept.\nIt’s similar because the belief is that people who specialize are the ones who advance. But the truth is that people who are multidisciplinary are the most innovative and the most useful indviduals\nSee also Being multi disciplinary and multi sport\nIt’s different because it just feels very different than what the culture values\nIt’s important because if we are going to educate kids on how to do well in society.

It started out as an idea I had. I wanted to better understand what “sensemaking” was and how it worked.\n\nSo I made a new note.\nIt was called “triangulation”\nI looked up stuff and brushed up on the history of triangulation in navigation.\nSlowly, the note developed into a direction I could not plan for ahead of time.\nI adjusted the title to match what was growing within the note.\n\nSo “triangulation” became “Sensemaking through triangulation”\n\n\nI felt the spark of wanting to share this idea.\nThat’s when it became an effort!\nThat forced the title to change one more time.\n\nSo “Sensemaking through triangulation” became Sensemaking happens by triangulation.

That is keeping you from being active or doing the things you want to do.\nI know how frustrating and debilitating this can be. I’ve been there myself. But I’m here to tell you that you can do something about it.\nThere are ways to get relief from your pain and get your life back. I’m not going to promise you that it will be easy. But I can promise you that it will be worth it.\nAnd while we can’t make it better 5 videos, we can begin a journey to think about what getting better looks like.\nI’m here to help you every step of the way. So please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n—-\nI want to start by saying that you have the amazing ability to recover. \nIt may seem hard to believe right now. But the body’s ability to recover is already a part of you. It is wired in your DNA. We evolved to recover from injuries. This is necessary if we were to survive.\nYou might ask, so what happened? \nWhy does it still feel injured even though my body has this ability to bounce back? \nHow did I get stuck?\nAnd while this is not a simple question to answer, let’s start by looking at one place - the mind.\n—-\nWhenever we experience pain, get hurt or injured. Our brain remembers that pain and where it came from- and it does it to protect you!\nThis is useful, and good for you. \nEspecially if you think about our early ancestors and how they had to make sense of the world.\nIf you’re out in the jungle hunting for wild animals, and you touch some poison ivy and it becomes itchy and painful. \nThe memory of that pain is there to make sure that you never touch it again! Your mind will remember that pain so that you don’t make that mistake again.\n–\nThe same thing happens when you injure your body.\nImagine that you’re going for a run, and your ankle starts feeling  painful. You get it checked, and the doctor tells you it’s a sprain. He gives you some medicine, and tells you to rest and stretch it for 2 weeks. \nWhen your body recovers, your mind still remembers- \n“Oh when I did that run, I hurt my ankle- so I should avoid running because it’s dangerous.”\nThat’s your mind trying to protect you!\nThe problem comes in when our bodies have , but our mind is still in pain and high alert mode\nWe want to find that sweet spot for you. \nBecause too much fear, too much worry can keep you from doing anything. After all, one way to never get injured is to sit on the couch and never move again! But that’s not what you want.\nSo you don’t want to suppress your fear, go out and be completely reckless. That’s not the right way to go about it also.\nYou have to find that goldilocks area- and to do that you need to deal with the fear in your mind.\n–\nAnd the first thing I want to dispel from your fear is that your body is beyond repair\nWe still have this old idea that movement and our bodies are like cars and machines. That if there is pain it’s because something is out of alignment or something is out of place. \nThen we end up believing that if there’s  pain that won’t go away, then something must be out of place in my body.\nBut that is an outdated model and is too simple.\nIt’s funny to say, but remember your body is a living, breathing, adapting, and growing thing. You are not some car that gets more and more broken down as time passes.\nYour body is adaptable. It can change and adjust depending on all sorts of situations that you experience.\n– \nAnd when you look at the human body and how it has evolved, it is clear that we were meant to move. \nWe have long legs and arms that are perfect for walking and running. We also have strong muscles that allow us to carry heavy objects. \nFor millions of years, we were hunter-gatherers who walked long distances and carried things to find food and shelter.\nBut today, most of us live very different lives. We don’t have to walk long distances to find food. And we don’t have to carry heavy loads. Instead, we sit in cars and offices all day. We don’t use our muscles very much and we don’t get the chance to move around a lot.\nSo, it’s important to remember what our bodies evolved to do. \nTrust me, you’re not going to undo thousands of years of evolution by getting injured that one time\nYour body can bounce back- and you have to bring your mind into that journey also\n–\nThe second thing to dispel is the belief that you’ve made irreversible damage to your body.\nMost people believe that once they injure their body, it’s irreversible. They think it will never be 100% again.\nBut the truth is, most injuries recover well. And our bodies adapt to the injuries that take place. \nYes, there are some serious injuries that are the exception. But for the most part, I’d say 99% of injuries recover well.\nI see this the most with food and diet. You believe that if you’ve been eating unhealthy foods for years, you’ll never be 100% healthy. But the truth is, regular healthy eating can reverse most of that.\nIf you’ve been living a sedentary lifestyle for many years, a few months of exercise will reverse a lot of that. \nSo, if you’re worried that you’ve gone too far, don’t be. You can always make changes to get your body back on track.\n–\nThe third fear that I want to dispel is that it’s too late to get back into action for me.\nDoes it feel like you’ve been meaning to get better, but then you put it off. Until you feel so far behind that you can’t catch up.\nYou’re not alone, many people feel this way. I have been there myself also.\nIt is easy to get stuck in thinking about how great my body used to be before I got injured. And it takes some mental work to move past that and start looking forward to how your body can be in the future.\nAnd to do that, you have to dispel the believe that it’s too let to get back. There are plenty of people who put of recovery, started late, but are now moving well and worry-free.\nSo, if you’re feeling like it’s too late for you to recover, don’t worry. It’s never too late to start working on it.\n–\nFinally, I want to add that getting back from injury is 20% inspiration and 80% practice. \nI hope with this series, you get that inspiration you need to trust your body again\nAnd then I hope you find ways to put that inspiration into practice\n**"},"Notes/How-people-use-F.U.D.-to-trap-you-(concept)":{"title":"How people use F.U.D. to trap you (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How people use F.U.D. to trap you (concept) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Ideas §\n\n\nFear, uncertainty, doubt\n\n\nThese are big ones in the industry, that they use to manipulate you\n\n\nImplicitly, it says I am the only one you can trust\n\n\nSo a salesperson will try to set up themselves as the only one with answers\n\n"},"Notes/How-religion-failed-to-compete":{"title":"How religion failed to compete","links":["Notes/Why-philosophy-is-better-than-science","Notes/Science-can-be-just-as-cherry-picky-as-religion"],"tags":["-on/religion-catholicism-authority-on/epistemology-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nreligion, via interdicts, allows the intergenerational transmission of survival heuristics and is effective in nudging people into some classes of behavior[16].\nEffectively, Catholicism lost its moral authority the minute it mixed epistemic and pisteic belief –breaking the link between holy and the profane.

This is misleading; it falsely implies that happiness comes in a one-size-fits-all package. The truth, as you’ve noticed, is more complex, resembling an intricate tapestry woven from multiple schools of thought, personal experiences, and cultural influences.\nHere are some thought-provoking inquiries for you:\n\nHave you been simply “inheriting” your ideas of happiness from your environment?\nAre there specific theories you’ve been unintentionally loyal to, which may not truly serve your unique well-being?\n\nThese questions make me think about how the concept of happiness is not an IKEA shelf, waiting to be assembled with an Allen wrench according to universal instructions. No, it’s more akin to creating your own sculpture, bit by bit, from an unshaped block of marble. You have the license to chisel away the extraneous, mix different artistic schools, and maybe even add splashes of color where they’re least expected.\nA journey into understanding multiple theories of happiness can equip you with a “toolbox” of sorts. This toolbox doesn’t necessarily dictate your happiness but allows for a nuanced understanding of it. The key is to not just adopt theories wholesale but to mix and match them in ways that resonate with you—after all, you’re the expert on your own well-being. By acknowledging the shades of gray, you grant yourself the freedom to fine-tune your personal happiness formula, instead of accepting some off-the-shelf solution.\nThis matters greatly in the broader scope of life satisfaction and well-being. Understanding that happiness isn’t a one-lane road but a sprawling, multi-dimensional landscape can empower you to be more compassionate towards others and their differing happiness theories. It also offers you the opportunity to update or replace any elements that aren’t serving you well, much like a software patch that fine-tunes a complex program.\nWhy not embark on an “happiness exploration,” just like one might hike through a foreign land, keeping the best finds and discarding the unhelpful, until you’ve created your custom guidebook for a fulfilling life?\n\nRead more at: Eleven theories for how to achieve true happiness\nGo one level up : Philosophy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Human Nature and The Happiness Lottery"},"Notes/How-to-Deal-with-Fads":{"title":"How to Deal with Fads","links":["Notes/Some-methods-today-will-seem-no-brute-force-in-the-future","Notes/The-End-of-History-Illusion"],"tags":[],"content":"How to Deal with Fads §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea §\n\nThere will always be new fads\nBut we’re always learning\n\nSee also §\n\n\nMakes me think of plagues\n\nand how we treat diseases\nSome methods today will seem no brute force in the future\n\n\n\nHow to Talk about fads\n\n\nThe End of History Illusion\n\n"},"Notes/How-to-Delegate-a-task":{"title":"How to Delegate a task","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://profitfactory.com/360delegation/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nReally great article\nVision\nResources\nDefinition of Done\nSee also §"},"Notes/How-to-Design-Behavior-by-BJ-Fogg":{"title":"How to Design Behavior by BJ Fogg","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How to Design Behavior by BJ Fogg §\nSource §\n\n\n\nKey Ideas §\n\nI really like the 2 maxims idea here\n"},"Notes/How-to-Engage-on-Twitter":{"title":"How to Engage on Twitter","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How to engage on Twitter §\nPlease remember that it’s not about being smart or clever\nIt’s always about providing value.\nSo when you tweet and reply\nBe smart and funny and kind.\nBe likeable"},"Notes/How-to-Get-Rich-by-Naval":{"title":"How to Get Rich by Naval","links":["Naval","tags/on/video"],"tags":["on/video"],"content":"\nAuthor: Naval\nFull Title: How to Get Rich\nUrl: https://youtu.be/1-TZqOsVCNM?t=9301\nCategory:#on/video\ntags:\n\n\nTitle §\n\nHighlights (with time stamps) §\n\n2:31\n\nAdvice are like anecdotes and maxims that I can recall\n\n\n3:13\n\nThe Schilling Point\n\n\n\nKey Ideas (to develop into individual notes) §"},"Notes/How-to-Get-Young-People-to-Stop-Smoking":{"title":"How to Get Young People to Stop Smoking","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","Notes/Bad-habits-are-autocatalytic"],"tags":["-smoking-","-health-","-habits-","-culture-"],"content":"I learned something interesting about smoking and why so few people now smoke.

Sugar is bad and this is bad.\nThe core idea:\nIf you identify as being anti-establishment, then showing how bad behaviors are establishment behaviors can cause identity change\nThe podcast excerpt is here:\nHow to Get Young People to Stop Smoking | 1min snip from Huberman Lab\n\nThe full episode is here:\nDr. Elissa Epel: Control Stress for Healthy Eating, Metabolism &amp; Aging\nGo one level up : Habits MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Bad habits are autocatalytic"},"Notes/How-to-Harvest-Seeds-(PCAARD)":{"title":"How to Harvest Seeds (PCAARD)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Havesting Seeds according to PCAARD document §\n\nAllow plants to dry\nChoose good plants for good genetics\nThresh and dry\nCan be stores\n\n"},"Notes/How-to-Make-Things-Simple-to-Solve-Big-Problems":{"title":"How to Make Things Simple to Solve Big Problems","links":["Maps/Health-Mindsets-MOC","Notes/Creative-problem-problem-sovling-is-like-improv"],"tags":["decomplications","solutions","simplicity","decision-making"],"content":"As humans, we’re not good at making tradeoffs.

So they see doctors, and they see physical therapists. And then they get stuck because they can’t get past the injury- they’re stuck in the lack of confidence.\nThey’re stuck with these thoughts.\nWhat if I’m not 100%?\nWhat if I’m the exception and my body didn’t recover full?\nWhat if I’ll never move well again?\nIf you’re thinking these thoughts, you’re not giving your body a chance to heal. You’re not giving yourself a chance to get better.\nThese thoughts become a self fulfilling prophecy!\nThe solution that you need is to build up confidence in your body and recovery after injury §\nHere are some tips to continue your recovery and build up confidence after injury §\n\nAvoid the Google searching\n\nThis is a tricky one because we feel like we need more information to get better. But there’s a paradox with doing our own research- it’s because there’s so much information out there that it makes you feel less confident instead of more confident.\nHow many times have you tried searching on Google for the right thing to do but end up feeling more overwhelmed and confused with what the right thing to do is?\nInformation overload is a real thing, and it keeps people stuck\n\nSeek out a support group\n\nWhen it comes to building confidence after injury, try seeking out a support group.There are often groups available for people recovering from injury. This can be a great way to meet others in similar situations and to gain support and motivation.\nInjury can be a very isolating experience. It can be difficult to adjust to a new lifestyle and to cope with the physical and emotional challenges that come with it. A support group can provide a much-needed sense of community and can be a great source of advice and support.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, ask your doctor or rehabilitation team if they know of any support groups in your area. You can also search online for groups that focus on specific injuries or conditions.\n\nFind a coach or trainer who focuses on mindset\n\nMany times, working with a coach or trainer can help increase your confidence. They can help you set appropriate goals and give you the guidance and support you need to reach those goals.\nThis is something that is overlooked, because we see injury just as a physical issue. But if you’re struggling with confidence, you will benefit more from seeing a counselor or mindset coach who can help you work though negative thoughts and feelings.\nIf you’re dealing with an injury, it’s important to find a coach or trainer who understands your situation and can help you build confidence. They can help you set appropriate goals and give you the guidance and support you need to reach those goals.\nThis is something that is overlooked, because we see injury just as a physical issue. But if you’re struggling with confidence, you will benefit more from seeing a counselor or mindset coach who can help you work though negative thoughts and feelings.\n\nGet back to your sport or activity-\n\nWhen you’re injured, it’s easy to lose confidence. You may feel like you’re not good enough, or like you’ll never be able to do what you used to do.\nBut it’s important to remember that you can get better. And one of the best ways to do that is to get back to the sport or activity that you love as soon as you can. This is often the hardest step, but it’s also the most important. Getting back to the activity or sport that you love will help you to remember why you’re doing all of this in the first place. It will also help your body to continue to heal and to get stronger.\nOf course, you’ll need to be careful. Don’t push yourself too hard, and listen to your body. But if you can, getting back to the sport or activity that you love will help you on the road to recovery.\n\nCelebrate the wins, no matter how small\n\nI was in a car accident a few years ago that left me with some serious injuries. I was in a lot of pain and had to miss a lot of work. I was also really afraid that I would never be able to do the things I used to be able to do.I had to start my rehabilitation from scratch and it was a long and difficult journey. But, I am happy to say that I am now back to my old self and I am even better than before.\nOne of the things that helped me the most during my rehabilitation was celebrating the wins, no matter how small. Every time I was able to do something that I thought I wouldn’t be able to do, I would take a moment to celebrate.\nIt sounds like a small thing, but it made a big difference for me. It helped me to stay positive and motivated, and it also helped me to feel like I was making progress.\nIf you are currently injured, or if you have recently been injured, I encourage you to try celebrating the wins, no matter how small. It might just make a big difference for you too.\nYour mind is the number 1 killer of injury recovery. §\nIf you want to recover, you have to change your mindset. You have to start thinking positively. You have to start believing in yourself.\nIt’s not easy, but it’s so worth it.\nIf you need help, please reach out.

But here are a few things to consider that may help you make the decision.\n\nHow severe is the injury?\n\nIf you’ve just hurt yourself and the pain is manageable, you may not need to see a doctor. But if the pain is severe or you’re having trouble using the injured body part, it’s probably time to seek medical attention.\n\nIs the pain getting worse?\n\nIf the pain from your injury is getting worse instead of better, it’s time to see a doctor.\n\nAre you having other symptoms?\n\nIf you’re injured and also experiencing other symptoms like fever, chills, or nausea, it’s a good idea to see a doctor. These could be signs of a more serious problem.\n\nIs the injury preventing you from doing your usual activities?\n\nIf you can’t do your usual activities because of your injury, it’s time to see a doctor.\n\nAre you worried about the injury?\n\nIf you’re feeling anxious or stressed about your injury, it’s a good idea to see a doctor. Worrying about an injury can make it harder to heal.\nIf you’re still not sure whether or not you should see a doctor, it’s always a good idea to err on the side of caution. You can always call your doctor’s office to ask for their opinion.\nIn general, it’s a good idea to see a doctor if you’re in pain, the pain is getting worse, you’re having other symptoms, or you’re worried about the injury.\nIt’s a good idea to see a doctor if you’re feeling anxious or stressed about your injury.

And it’s frustrating. And that’s not what you want to hear.\nBut that’s the truth. It’s not inevitable. You will get hurt at some point, and you will have pain.\nSo you’ll see a doctor and visit a physical therapist. Maybe 2 times a week. Maybe 3.\nBut they’ll all tell you the same thing\n“If you want to recover, you’re going to have to do these exercises at home.”\nAnd that’s the hardest part.\nAt the end of the day, you are responsible for being engaged in recovering from injury at home §\nResearch shows that only 35% of physical therapy patients fully adhere to their plans of care.1 That’s a staggeringly low number, and it turns out that most patients simply aren’t doing their prescribed physical therapy home exercise programs. The most common reasons cited are lack of motivation, questions regarding self-efficacy, and environmental blocks to movement.\nHow can you address the factors in the study?\nHow can I deal with lack of motivation? §\nOne of the best ways to overcome a lack of motivation is to have a plan.\nBefore you start your at-home exercises, sit down and map out exactly what you need to do and when you need to do it. This will help you stay on track and make sure that you’re doing everything you need to in order to recover.\nIt’s important to set realistic goals for your at-home exercise program. If you’re too ambitious, you’re likely to get discouraged and give up. On the other hand, if your goals are too easy, you won’t see the results you’re hoping for.\nConsider also getting a partner\nRecovering from an injury can be a lonely process, but it doesn’t have to be. Find a friend or family member who can help you with your at-home exercises. This will not only make the process more enjoyable, but it will also help you stay accountable.\nFinally take it one day at a time\nRecovering from an injury can be a long and difficult process. It’s important to take it one day at a time and not get too ahead of yourself. Set small goals and celebrate each and every accomplishment, no matter how small.\nHow can I feel sure that what I’m doing works? §\nFirst, it’s important to understand that your fear, worry, and anxiety are all perfectly normal.\nIf you’re trying to recover from injury, it’s easy to feel like you have to do it perfectly or you’ll make things worse. We live in a time of information overload and optimization- so it’s common to have the feeling “If I’m not doing this perfectly, I’m making things worse.”\nBut the reality is that the body is incredibly resilient. And a lot of research shows that movement is always better than no movement at all. Don’t let analysis-paralysis keep you from moving your body more.\nEven if you’re not sure you’re doing the exercises correctly, getting up and moving around is better than sitting still.\nAnd if you’re still feeling unsure about your ability to recover, consider working with an online coach while you’re at home.\nA coach can help you understand the exercises you need to do and can provide reassurance that you’re on the right track.\nThe bottom line is that you need to feel confident that you’re helping your body get better. Whatever you need to get to that confidence is important!\nHow can I make it easier for me to do what I need to do? §\nSo many blogs and books have been devoted to building up your habits. (Start with Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg 2)\nMy favorite way to make things easier is to reduce the friction involved. That means making it as easy as possible to do the things you need to do.\nThere are many ways to do this- and to start listing them would end up focusing on hacks and not the principles.\nIf I say “Set up a dedicated spot to exercise” or “Always do your rehab at the same time,” these both rely on the principle that having a dedicated time and place makes it easier for the brain to remember to do it.\nYou can try different things, as long as you’re making it easy for yourself.\nIf you’re feeling resistance, step back and ask “How can I make this come from a place of ease and flow?”\nIt’s important to know yourself. What has worked for you in the past? Why did it work? Is there a way to replicate that again?\nThe best way to find out is to experiment. Try something new and see if it works. If it does, great! If not, try something else.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, brainstorm with a friend or coach.\nThey may have some great ideas that you haven’t thought of. Injury recovery is never fun. But by following these tips, you can make it a little easier on yourself.\nAnd the sooner you start, the sooner you’ll be back to moving!\n\nFootnotes §\n\n\nFetching Title#ad1l ↩\n\n\nFetching Title#0joe ↩\n\n\n"},"Notes/How-to-make-things-look-effortless":{"title":" How to make things look effortless ","links":["Notes/Develop-a-Plug-and-Play-System-to-10x-Results","Maps/Concepts-MOC","Notes/Work-on-the-Invisible-Things"],"tags":["-willpower-","-effort-","-systems-","-coaching-","-concept-"],"content":"Somehow, Stephen King can write a book a year.\nHe makes it look so effortless.

I’m not sure what I should be doing, but I know that nutrition is a key part of the healing process.I’m thinking about using supplements to help me recover. I’m not sure what to take or how to think about it, but I know that it can be helpful. Here’s how to think about dietary supplements when you’re recovering from injury.\nFirst, it’s important to get clearance from your doctor before you start taking any supplements. Once you have the green light, there are a few things to keep in mind.\nFirst, focus on whole foods. Supplements are not a replacement for a healthy diet. In fact, they should be used to complement a healthy diet.\nSecond, choose supplements that are specific to your needs. If you’re trying to improve your joint health, for example, there are specific supplements that can help with that.\nThird, work with a registered dietitian or other nutrition professional to create a plan that’s right for you. They can help you figure out what supplements you need and how to take them.\nFinally, be patient. It takes time for your body to heal. The supplements you take now may not show results for weeks or even months. But if you’re consistent and focus on a healthy recovery, you’ll get there.\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of whether or not to take dietary supplements when recovering from an injury. However, it’s important to remember that nutrition is a key part of the healing process. Supplements can be helpful, but it’s important to be patient and consistent with your recovery."},"Notes/How-we-get-stuck-in-injury-mode":{"title":"How we get stuck in injury mode","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Change the video to just this one simple thing"},"Notes/How-we-self-sabotage":{"title":" How we self sabotage ","links":["Maps/Psychology-MOC","Notes/How-to-Trust-Your-Inner-Voice"],"tags":["-youtube-","-psychology-","-pain-"],"content":"\nWatch my video here:  How we Self-Sabotage our Recovery\nGo one level up : Psychology MOC\nYou may also be interested in: How to Trust Your Inner Voice"},"Notes/How-we-unconsciously-parent":{"title":"How we unconsciously parent","links":["Steven-Schlafman","Maps/Parenting-MOC","Notes/Post-Traumatic-Growth"],"tags":["-parenting-","-children-","-trauma-","-self-care-"],"content":"I read this really powerful article from Steven Schlafman.

You don’t want to risk making things worse but you also don’t want to sit on the sidelines forever. Here’s what you need to know to find the right balance. Injuries are never fun.\nWhether you’re a world-class athlete or a weekend warrior, getting sidelined with an injury is never fun. It’s frustrating, can be discouraging, and can set you back from your training and goals.\nBut just because you’re injured doesn’t mean you have to sit on the sidelines forever. In fact, if you’re careful and take the right precautions, you can get back to your activities much sooner than you think.\nOf course, the key word here is “careful.” Pushing yourself too hard too soon can lead to further injury, so it’s important to find the right balance.\nThat’s where pacing comes in.\nPacing is all about finding the right balance between pushing yourself and taking it easy. It’s about listening to your body and giving it the time it needs to heal.\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to pacing, but there are some general guidelines you can follow.\nFirst, start with low-impact activities and gradually increase the intensity as you feel ready.\nIf you’re a runner, for example, start with walking and then add in some light jogging when you’re feeling good. Don’t try to pick up where you left off before your injury.\nSecond, don’t be afraid to back off if you start to feel pain or discomfort.\nIt’s normal to feel some pain and discomfort as you’re getting back into activity, but it shouldn’t be severe. If it is, take a step back and reassess.\nFinally, be patient.\nInjuries can take time to heal, so don’t expect to be back to 100% overnight. Pacing yourself and giving your body the time it needs will pay off in the long run.\nOf course, the best way to pace yourself is with the help of a coach or professional. They can help you create a plan that’s tailored to your individual needs and goals.\nBut even if you don’t have a coach, following the tips above can help you find the right balance and get back to your activities safely.\nPacing yourself is key when recovering from an injury. You don’t want to risk making things worse, but you also don’t want to sit on the sidelines forever. Finding the right balance is important, and with careful consideration you can get back to your activities much sooner than you think."},"Notes/How-you-spend-your-free-time-says-a-lot-about-you":{"title":"How you spend your free time says a lot about you","links":["Notes/The-tension-between-something-being-practical-and-being-for-show"],"tags":["-free-time-on/freedom-learning-liesure-study-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\ncity-journal.org\nSpotting Talent | City Journal\nurl: https://www.city-journal.org/spotting-talent\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nHow you spend your free time actually matters a lot and says a lot about you\nWhat are the open tabs in your browser right now?” The authors contend that this question captures a person’s intellectual habits, level of curiosity, and how he or she spends her free time, all at once.

thirsty in my life.\nI’ve thought about it,\nand was trying to come up with a time\nwhen I remember truly being thirsty and worried about my next drink.\nBut I’ve got nothing.\nThe closest I can think of is one time when I climbed Mount Mariveles in Bataan last year.\nIt was a 6 hour hike and I stupidly brought just one liter of water.\nI didn’t know what I was getting into\nAnd I wasn’t prepared.\nSo by the time I reached summit,\nI had already run out of water,\nand I was only 3 hours into the trek.\nI was going to have to head back down the mountain without any water at all.\nWas I thirsty?\nSure I wanted a drink.\nBut was I DYING of thirst?\nThat seems a bit extreme.\nI was uncomfortable for sure.\nI wanted it to end.\nI was REALLY looking forward to getting a drink.\nBut I definitely was not at the point where I could think of nothing but water.\nEating Dried Fish §\nThis does remind me of a story from the spiritual tradition:\n“A novice in the seminary wished to have a vision of Jesus Christ in his dreams,\nbut despite his best efforst to contemplate and meditate,\nhe was incapable of achieving this vision.\nSo he approached his superior and asked for advice.\nHis superior said:\n‘My son, this evening, you must eat a lot of salted fish (daing),\nthen perform your prayers and go to bed without drinking any water.\nThen you will receive your vision.’\nThe novice followed this advice\nThat night, he spent the whole night dreaming he was drinking from streams, fountains and springs.\nWhen morning came, he ran crying to his superior:\n“O Master, I did not have my vision of Christ.\nI was so thirsty that all I dreamed about was drinking from fountains and springs.\nI am still on fire with thirst.”\nAnd his superior told him:\n“So eating salter fish gave you such a thirst that you dreamed all night of nothing but water.\nNow you must feel the same thirst for Jesus,\nand you will behold him in his blessed beauty.”\nIt is a simple story to make a quick point.\nWhen you’re really thirsty you can only think about one thing.\nWhether it’s water, or seeing Jesus, it has to be the only thing on your mind\nHave you ever desired anything so much that it consumed all your thoughts?\nWhat is your most powerful desire?\nWhat are you most thirsty for?\nJesus’ thirst §\nIn John’s Gospel, when Jesus knew that all was finished, he said “I am thirsty.”\nUsual interpretations talk about Jesus’ thirst for his people.\nHe desires our salvation.\nHe is thirsty for souls.\nHe wants to deliver the world from sin.\nThese are beautiful interpretations.\nAnd today I’m noticing how uncomfortable it feels.\nLike running out of water on a hike\nLike eating salted fish without water\nThirst isn’t just desire.\nIt’s desire to the point of physical discomfort\nIt’s about squirming in bed from being thirsty.\nIf it’s about wanting so bad that it’s physically uncomfortable,\nI can’t think of any better description of Jesus being on the cross.\nHe is so focused on what he wants that it hurts.\nQuite literally\nHe desires our salvations so much that it’s the only thing he can think about.\nThat’s what I see when I see a thirsty Jesus on the cross.\nWhat is it like to desire one thing only so much that I cannot think about anything else?\nWhat physical thirst feels like §\nThe physiologists who specialize in thirst seem never to have experienced it.\nThis surprises me.\nYou would think that someone interested in thirst would want to stop drinking for a while.\nIt is easy to arrange, and can be done safely.\nBut the physiologists pursue knowledge, not experience.\nThey use words based in Greek, which soften the subject.\nFor instance, they would describe the Sahara — the burning sand, the fierce, relentless sky — as dipsogenic, meaning “thirst-provoking.”\nIn discussing Lag Lag’s case, they might say he progressed from eudipsia, meaning “ordinary thirst,” through bouts of hyperdipsia, meaning “temporary intense thirst,” to polydipsia, by which they mean “sustained, excessive thirst.”\nWe can define it more precisely: since poly means “many,” polydipsia means “the kind of thirst that drives you to drink anything. ”\nThere are specialized terms for such behavior, including uriposia, “the drinking of urine,” and hemoposia, “the drinking of blood.”\nFor word enthusiasts, this is heady stuff.\nNonetheless, the lexicon has not kept up with technology.\nBlame the ancients for not driving cars.\nI have tried, and cannot coin a suitable word for “the drinking of radiator coolant.”\nGetting pulled in different directions §\nI am struck by how this is so VERY not my experience today.\nUnlike Jesus on the cross, I feel like I’m pulled in a thousand different directions.\nOne minute I’m thinking about writing this sharing\nThen I’m jumping to a YouTube video\nSuddenly my Viber rings and there’s a message.\nI hear the doorbell and a delivery has arrived.\nWhat was I doing again?\nOh yes! I was writing\nHmm. I wonder what’s for dinner\nding another notification\nMy mind is all over the place (At best)\nAnd tends to feel hijacked (at worst)\nWork, social media, chores, errands\nI need to go to the bank.\nI need to pick this my clothes.\nMy experience today is that\nI am SO not able to focus on one thing only.\nThere’s a reason the movie\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\nwas so popular last year.\nWhy choose one thing when I can be everything?\nWhy choose one place when I can be everywhere?\nWhat is happening in this world?\nWhat are all these gadgets?\nWho are these people?\nIt’s all TOO much.\nI need it to stop.\nTrying to stop the noise §\nHow can I stop being pulled apart?\nMediation?\nMindfulness?\nPrayer?\nBrathing?\nIsn’t that all the range now.\nGo on another retreat\nAttend another talk\nDownload a new meditation app\nRead another book on contemplation\nIt’s not stopping.\nSomehow it isn’t exactly what I’m thirsty for.\nSpirituality of Imperfection §\nI’m reminded of St. Thérèse of Lisieux\nwho shares a story from her childhood.\nWhen her older sister, Léonie was getting too old to play with her dolls,\nshe put them in a basket with the dolls and play dresses.\nShe gave them to her younger sisters, Céline and Thérèse.\nsaying, “Here dears, choose whichever one you like.”\nCéline saw a ball of wool that she wanted, and took that.\nTwo year old Thérèse looks at the basket, the dolls, and the dresses, and declares “I choose everything.” And she took the whole basket with her.\nI also want everything §\nAnd I feel this in myself too-\nI want everything.\nI want to a be in prayer and in mass,\nbut when I am there I also want to think about other things.\nI want to choose simplicity,\nbut I also want comfort, travel, or the many great experiences of this world.\nI want to live humbly,\nbut I also want a good repuation, to be respected and liked by people around me.\nI want everything.\nThe man who wills one thing §\nThe cleanest definition of saintfood for me comes from Soren Kirekegaard\nwho said: “to be a saint, it to will the one thing.”\n“to be a saint, it to will the one thing.”\nNot to be distracted.\nNot to lose focus.\nNot to try to choose everything.\nBut to choose one thing only.\nIt is not easy to be so single minded- to will one THE ONE THING\nBut this Jesus on the cross\nWhen Jesus is on the cross, and he says he’s thirsty-\nThat is his singular focus\nHis powerful desire\nThat he only wants one thing\nAnd nothing else matters\nHe doesn’t want it all\nHe want one thing only\n“Seek first the kingdom, and all things shall be added”\nWhy am I not thirstier? §\nSo why am I stuck?\nWhy am I distracted?\nWhy am I not thirsty enough?\nWhy is my mind going from place to place to place to place?\nWhy can’t I be thirsty for God to the point that God is all I can think about?\nI have been truly thirsty in the past §\nI said at the start that I haven’t been TRULY thirsty in my life.\nBut I realize that’s not completely true.\nDuring the pandemic, I was not physically allowed to go to mass. And while I am grateful that we could participate in online mass— I could feel myself getting thirstier and thirstier.\nI didn’t want to just take in sips\nI wanted to drink deeply\nI was so thirsty then…\n15 years ago I lived in China for 1 year.\nI visited a town where there was 1 church in the whole city.\nAnd it was a good 3 hour drive from where I was\nThere was only 1 church in the whole city, and it was a 2 hour drive.\nWhen I went to mass it was completely different.\nNo mumbling of prayers and ‘Our Fathers’\nNo half hearted responses\nJust true thirst- and people so thankful to be drinking Living Water.\nWater is only valuable, and amazing for the person who is truly thirsty.\nAnd Living Water is life giving, only to the person who has this thirst too.\nIsaiah 55:1-2 §\nMy all-time favorite verse in the bible is from the book of Isaiah\n1 \n“Ho, every one who thirsts, \ncome to the waters; \nand he who has no money, \ncome, buy and eat! \nCome, buy wine and milk \nwithout money and without price. \n2 \nWhy do you spend your money for that which is not bread, \nand your labor for that which does not satisfy? \nHearken diligently to me, and eat what is good, \nand delight yourselves in fatness. \nYou will hear this verse again during the Easter Vigil Mass.\nBut I love this verse because of its promise.\nIt’s so simple and clear.\nAre you thirsty?\nThis will quench your thirst.\nAre you tired?

Sometime we pinpoint it sooner than other times. Whenever we do, we engage the dual-mind.\nThe Dual Mind\nThe Dual Mind refers to the conscious/subconscious minds.\nWe need to develop the skills, awareness, and intuition to identify POCs that can derail our day; so we can effectively deal with them like a master in Aikido would.\nTwo Micro Habits to improve: §\n\nRecognize harmful POCs\nEffectively deal with harmful POCs\n\nThis is about winning the point of contact.

I was so afraid that was it. I had hurt myself, and I would never be as strong again.\nI nervously went in to see a doctor, who told me that I needed surgery. So I agreed, I went into it. When I woke up from surgery the doctor told me:\n“Hey you’re up- The surgery was great, your knee is now better than new.” \nI was so relieved and grateful. And I went on to get back to my sports and hobbies.\n—\nNow for Doctor #2,\nIn 2020, I was having some nerve pain going down my arm. This was a new and unfamiliar injury, so I wanted to make sure it was nothing serious.\nLike last time, I nervously went to see a doctor. She did some tests and then told me\n“You’ve got a pinched nerve. We can treat it, but it’s also going to keep coming back again and again and again.”\nThat was not reassuring, and actually quite scary. I didn’t know what I could do.\nAnd it turned out to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nI got more worried, more stressed, and more anxious. That made my body more tense and tight. Which made my nerve pain worse!\n—\nEver since then I’ve been on a journey to understand pain more. And today I want to talk about how your beliefs, what your doctor says actually matters a lot.\nOne big thing we are learning is that there’s much more to injury and pain than just the physical\nPart of that is our social environment. Here’s a great clip that sums it up\nWhen a kid falls down, they first look to their parents to see how they should react.\nIf they react with fear and worry, the child learns that\nIf they are calm, and they say it’s okay- we learn that too.\nThe parents’ response actually informs how they interact and understand pain\nThat means pain and how we react to it is learned\n—\nPlus there’s the curious case of placebo surgeries.\nWhat happens here is that doctors did a fake operation.\nBut people improved just as much as people who got real operations.\nI’m not saying all surgery and medicine is a sham.

Worry about structure later.\nIf you’ve got around 100-500 notes\nSome of your favorite notes will become harder to find. You’ll start to desire a way to structure and organize your notes. Like a vampire thirsting for blood, you’ll find yourself gravitating toward the creation of MOCs.\nIf you’ve got around 1000-5000 notes\nYou’ll want to structure your structures. This is where these flexible frameworks starts providing mega-value. There are a lot of benefits.\nIf you’ve got 5000-50,000 notes\nNote retrieval issues become amplified: can you find the thing you’re looking for? I would say your only hope is a fundamentally robust set of co-existing frameworks. Hopefully a library with LYT frameworks can scale effectively at these numbers. You’ll probably have MOCs built upon other MOCs. I would imagine the Home note (along with search) would be your initial launching pad.\n\nIf you have Asperger’s, or ADHD, or you just tend to over-organize §\nI implore you to approach the LYT Kit with caution. Sure, it’s awesome, but you can’t leap to “11” and bypass counting “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10”. The only structure that can work over time, is the structure that slowly emerges over time—validating its own existence through its use.\nThis kit shows you how to get there, but DO NOT start structuring your “ultimate” system right now. It will fail you, because it will be fragile, because it wasn’t forged in the fire of practical usage.

This word started to really pick up steam in the 1980s when young, seemingly healthy executives in Japan would suddenly die. Having insane working hours (110 hours a week), and highly stressful responsibilities all contributed to their demise.\nIn English, we have words like “fatigued” or “burnt out,” though those don’t quite capture the severity of working yourself to the point where you are actively hurting your body. You’re so focused on work that you’re killing yourself.\nI think in fitness, there’s a “death by overwork” culture also.\nThe Problem with “No Pain, No Gain.” §\nEvery time I see an Instagram post that talks about “Going past your limits,” or “Pushing your body to the extreme,” I cringe a little bit.\nI mean, I get it. Some people love this language. It motivates. It gets them moving. It lets them run that marathon. Or force out that extra pull up.\nBut I’m afraid that the prevalence of this “No Pain, No Gain” mindset is setting us all up for some big problems down the line.\nShouldn’t I push myself in my workouts? §\nBut isn’t pushing yourself part of how you improve and get stronger? If you’re too comfortable when training, you won’t ever progress.\nYes, that’s true. So here’s where we can make a distinction. (And be fair to the “no pain, no gain-ers.”)\nChallenging yourself and putting yourself in some discomfort helps stimulate growth. It’s true in fitness and in life. If you stay in your comfort zone all the time, you won’t grow as an individual.\nBut similarly, if you’re always in discomfort, pushing yourself in your life. And then losing out on sleep. Getting sick. Continuing past that. Well… you get “Karoshi”- “death by overwork.” It’s that extreme that I want to be careful to avoid. And I think in our culture, we have a tendency to encourage overwork.\nYes, you must challenge yourself. But in the process, ever ignore your pain. If your knees hurt. Or if you can’t even get out of bed in the morning. That’s your body telling you that you’re overdoing it. You’ve gone past “challenging” and have entered into “damaging.”\nTrading off a short term fix, for long term challenges (analogy) §\nThink of it like a car, which is full of many intricate parts. I can push its performance, but only for so long. After a while, things will start to wear out. That check engine light will turn on.\nIn our bodies, pain is that “check engine light.” It will turn on when you push your body too much, and if you ignore it, things will only get worse.\nThe best thing to do would be to pull back. Address what needs to be addressed. And then use your car, and your body well. It will be useful, more efficient, and more long lasting.\nThe Long Term Cost §\nThe way so many people are training now- they’re driving their bodies to the point of getting wrecked. It’s “Karoshi” in fitness. “Death by overwork-out.”\nAnd the real long term cost shows up when you find that you’re in too much pain to get a good night’s sleep. Or you don’t have the energy to spend time with your friends and family. Or ultimately, you have health and body problems that limit your freedom, and prevent you from doing things.\nSolution: Going back to motivation §\nOne way to recalibrate is to ask yourself a simple question\n“What am I working out for anyway?”\nIs it a sense of accomplishment?\nIs it because I want to be healthier?\nIs it because I want to live long?\nDo I want to be present for my family and kids?\nWhatever it might be, framing your workouts this way can help you find that balance.\nIt’s a bit cliche, but when you hear\n“work to live, and not live to work,”\nyou can apply the same kind of thinking to working out\nWe “Workout to live, not live to workout.”\nDoes my exercise routine let me do the things I want to do and live the life I want to live?\nIf I want to live a healthy, happy life and be present to my friends and family. Then as cool as it might be to run really fast or jump really high, I can remember that it might affect my knees, and hurt my ability to stick to my real goals.\nThat’s the key idea:\nYour life is what you’re trying to be fit for."},"Notes/JFK-Fitness-Speech":{"title":"JFK Fitness Speech","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://youtu.be/E0WmpszjnN8\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/James-Clear-Quote":{"title":"James Clear Quote","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"James Clear Quote §\n“You do not rise to the level of your goals\nYou fall to the level of your systems”"},"Notes/James-Flyn-Psychometrician-Capitalization":{"title":"James Flyn Psychometrician Capitalization","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"James Flyn Psychometrician Capitalization §"},"Notes/James-clear's-steps-to-change":{"title":"James clear's steps to change","links":["Atomic-Habits"],"tags":[],"content":"James clear’s steps to change §\nSource: §\n\nAtomic Habits\n\nKey Ideas §\n\n\nStep 1: Decide who you want to be\n\n\nStep 2: Prove it to yourself with small wins\n\n\nIn the twelve steps programs, they have a saying:\n\n“Bring the Body and the mind will follow”\n\n\n"},"Notes/James-steele-defines-effort-as":{"title":"James steele defines effort as","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Effort according to James Steele §\nJames Steel defines effort as the ratio of the demands of the task to the capacity to meet those demands.\nHe uses it to measure and to quanitify effort and how much one feels like they’re doing.\nSource:\nThe movement podcast"},"Notes/Jasper-and-AI-AIauthor":{"title":"Jasper and AI AIauthor","links":[],"tags":["--"],"content":"The Rapid Book Outline Method\n(Jasper Recipe)\nThe AI Author\nAI Author Core Worksheets\n\n\nIdeal Customer Avatar\n\n\nSetting Goals and Knowing Competition\n\n\nFind your spine and content brief\n\n\n\nPublisher Rocket\nOnePage.io"},"Notes/Javier-Thank-You-GIF":{"title":"Javier Thank You GIF","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Jill-Hawkins":{"title":"Jill Hawkins","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Jiro-dreams-of-sushi-(Raw-Materials-story)":{"title":"Jiro dreams of sushi (Raw Materials story)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Jiro dreams of sushi (Raw Materials Story) §\nWant to make good sushi?\n80% of the work happens at 3am in the Tsukiji fish market"},"Notes/John-Didian-Quote":{"title":"John Didian Quote","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"We tell ourselves stories in order to live"},"Notes/John-Mayer-Belief":{"title":"John Mayer Belief","links":["Notes/Homo-Adorans-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"John Mayer Belief Song (story) §\nSource: §\n\nHis Performance with Ed Sheeran\n\nKey Ideas: §\n\nIt’s a good way of communicating that you’ll worship something\n\nSee also: §\n\nHomo Adorans (concept)\n"},"Notes/Jonathan-Blow-interview-on-Notion":{"title":"Jonathan Blow interview on Notion","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Jonathon Blow’s Interview on Notion §\nSource: §\n\nhttps://www.notion.so/blog/jonathan-blow\n"},"Notes/Josh-Waitzkin-on-recovery":{"title":"Josh Waitzkin on recovery","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Josh Waitzkin on recovery §\nWAITZKIN MODEL 3 - STRESS &amp; RECOVERY “Most people in high-stress, decision-making industries are always operating at this kind of simmering six, as opposed to the undulation between deep relaxation and being at a 10.” - Waitzkin\nThis is the best critique of hustle culture"},"Notes/Journaling-in-the-morning-is-an-important-habit":{"title":"Journaling in the morning is an important habit","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","tags/on/pd","Notes/Writing-down-daily-goals-in-the-morning-is-an-important-habit"],"tags":["habit","on/pd"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit,#on/pd\nJournaling in the morning is an important habit §\nSteps:\nImmediately upon waking, roll over and grab your phone or notebook or laptop, and start journaling. Type or write for 5 minutes.\nYou may find that 5 minutes is difficult to fill, but then after a time, it becomes difficult to stop.\nTry to limit yourself to 10 minutes - so you can leverage this jump-start of mental energy into the next golden habit: writing out your daily goals.\nWhy the Morning Journal is so important §\nWe live in the Information Age. The media - with its news, advertisements, and myriad of distractions - is only a click (or tap) away. (Or with phone “notifications” we don’t even have to do anything to have our mental focus  hijacked by the avalanche of distractions that haven’t earned the right to steal our attention). In this constant buzz of noise-feces, we lose touch with more than just our goals; we lose touch with ourselves - our intuition, our own thoughts, our voice, our own opinion, and the very sense of individuality that makes each of us unique. This is an invisible war for the soul, and we are losing — badly. By all external measures we can claim freedom, yet in the place where it matters most, in our ability to think and question and act on our own volition, we have unwittingly given up our minds to be shackled by the forces of outside stimuli. Stimuli that tells us how to think, that manipulates our emotions, making us incredulously angry at someone or some issue we’ve never met or likely don’t truly understand, and telling us how to feel about it, and giving us talking points for what to share about it. The low-hanging fruit of distraction is tempting, especially when our guard is down or our willpower is low. At these moments, we unconsciously and voluntarily relinquish the rights to our minds to the loudest megaphone. We willingly allow our mind to be hijacked. We place our head in the scabbard, we lock the gate and forget the key, we sleepwalk into slavery - a prison for the mind.\nHopefully now it’s clear that the Morning Journal is a fight for control over your life, because it’s a battle for your mind. It’s a fight for your authenticity. It’s a war for the very essence of who you are. It reconnects you to you. It gets you back in touch with the most important voice you need to be listening to: yourself.\nNext step: Writing down daily goals in the morning is an important habit\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2014-06-28\ncreated:: 2014-06-28\nmodified:: 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Journeying-Mindset":{"title":"Journeying Mindset","links":["Notes/Designing-your-Life-(book)"],"tags":[],"content":"Journeying Mindset §\nStory §\nThe walking camino\nGetting lost\nFeeling like I wasted my time\nIdea §\nThere’s this tyranny of the idea that If you’re not making progress you’re going backwards\nIt’s too linear.\nWhen I started the handstand.

AirBnb isn’t a thing yet.\nBesides, I don’t have data on my phone. So I just hop on the subway, pop out like a gopher and just start walking. I look left and right. I see the neon signs. I smell the fried octopus balls. I can hear people excitedly talking around me. I have some vague sense of where I am, but it doesn’t matter. I am 100% fully present.\nThere’s something about exploring, wandering, and even getting lost that is freeing. If I know I’m generally safe, my brain is finally allowed to relax and take in all the new stimuli around me. Everything is so fresh and new.\nIt’s a feeling I love. \nBeing open and seeing with fresh eyes. It happens when I travel, but I can experience it in other ways. When I’m learning a new skill or reading a nice book. I experience it when I’m exploring new ideas.\nIt’s a feeling of being alive and present in the moment. And it’s something I crave when I start to feel like my life is getting too routine.\nWhenever I feel stuck, or like I’m just going through the motions, I try to find ways to get lost. I go for a drive. I will try to visit a new place. It gives my brain that jump start to feel awake and aware.\n10 years later, I feel that way less and less.\nWhere has all the attention gone? §\nIt would be so easy to rant against social media and the internet here.\nAt the risk of being the elder millennial waving from his porch at the world, it’s just so damn convenient to stay inside, watch some YouTube, work from home, and stay in this little pod I made for myself. Going outside takes way more work than (I feel like) it used to.\nThese are the questions that are burning in my mind now:\n\nHow did it get so easy to zone out?\nWhy did we let it get this way?\nAre there any ideas on ‘attention’ that I resonate with? (Be it neuroscience, philosophy, theology, psychology)\n\nWhat can I do to get my attention back?\nSimone Weil on the Importance of Attention in Everyday Life §\n\nI first encountered Simone Weil in graduate school, and she’s been on and off my beside books for so many years. I cannot claim to really understand her thinking. The words are so mysterious and impenetrable- it feels like the ramblings of a wild, free mind.\nBut every once in a while, one of her ideas will strike a chord. I will happen to be at just the right place and time in my life where her words resonate fully.\nToday that is Weil’s ideas on attention.\nIn her own words:\nFor Weil, attention is a “negative effort,” one that requires that we stand still rather than lean in.\nI find this definition painful and exciting. The paradox in talking about effort in standing still is so amazing to me. I think of meditation, and mindfulness and how fucking hard it is to just stand still.\nIn a way, it is easier to lean in- to move- to take action- to be hasty and to make things happen.\nThe effort required in just being still is infuriating.\nAttention is not about focusing on finding answers for Weil. It’s not about getting to the end.\nIt is more about seeing questions and puzzles, and learning to sit with them even if we cannot find the answers. (Like koans in the Zen tradition)\nIn a subject like Mathematics, we can sit for a long time with a geometry problem, and at the end of an hour have made little progress.\nBut in that hour, we will have entered into “another more mysterious dimension” (Weil’s words).\nThis is a moral dimension: It is a space where, by our act of attention, we grasp what has always been the real mystery- the lives of our fellow human beings.\n–\nWhen I was in university, I was a Math student\nI tell people I got into math for the simple clarity that it comes with. There are proofs and there are numbers.\nBut as I advanced in my subjects, the problems got more complex- I was be stumped with problems and questions I couldn’t answer\nI remember this one night where I would lie awake, unable to sleep- thinking about a math problem. I would get up at 1 in the morning. Make some tea and then sit at my desk and continue to explore the possibilities of the problem. That was my favorite moment as a math student. The thrill of a puzzle that was beyond my current grasp.\nMath is not a step by step linear approach. It’s actually a lot of trial and error. Sitting with problems that seem to make no sense.\nMuch like Weil’s attention\n–\nAs I understand it then, attention is not about directing our will and energies into focusing on an issue or a problem. It is like a mystery, it is like getting lost- it’s like wandering around a new city and exploring something new.\nAttention is a preparation. It’s being ready to attend to something that may come across my reality today. It is when I see everything and everyone with a beginner’s mind\nWhen someone comes to my front door, and I send them away because I am busy with things that are imagined. I fail to attend to the reality in front of me\nAttend to the demands of reality, and not a fantasy you imagine\nAttention- a bit of right brain thinking §\nAll this talk about ‘attention’ reminds me of a time I wanted to learn how to draw.\nI am a mediocre artist at best.\nBut I always did envy my friends who could sketch and draw. There is something magical about being able to create something out of thin air, with nothing but a pencil and a scrap piece of paper. My artist friends recommended to the book “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain” by Betty Edwards.\nThere is a famous exercise in the book that involves upside down drawing.\nPicassos-Upside-Down-Man-Drawing-1024x536.webp\nYou can do this yourself to see:\nTake a piece of paper and try to draw the left image.\nIf you’re a beginner, and you try to draw the image on the left, it will be struggle. Your hand won’t cooperate with what you’re trying to do.\nBut simply flip the image around and try again. Draw the image on the right.\nIt will take you longer to do, but when you complete it, you’ll be surprised at how good your drawing actually looks!\nWhy does drawing upside down work? §\nThe short answer is it works because you are not solving, but you are just observing.\nWhen the image is upright, your brain says, “That’s a person in a chair! Okay. Let’s draw a person in a chair.”\nBut flip it around, and suddenly your brain goes, “That’s a weird squiggly line, and I’m just drawing a squiggly line.” 1\nYou’re not solving, you’re just observing.\nThis was a revelation to me.\nI wrote in Part 1 how I love to travel. Because the newness and unfamiliarity of visiting a place makes me more present and more observant. The familiarity of home makes my brain go “I already know what that is!” Travel opens me up.\nThis one exercise in “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain” was a revelation to me.\nIt was the first time I experienced that open-mindedness, curiosity, and “slow brain” without having to leave the four walls of my house. I wasn’t traveling, I was just at home. But I still felt like I was wandering and exploring.\nI never did finish the book.\nOr learn to draw.\nBut that book changed the way I think about thinking. And today I’ll build that to think about attention.\nAttention exists in our “right brain” §\nThere are a few ways that you can use to think about it:\nSome language uses the idea of being left-brained and right-brained (which is what the drawing book used).\nIt’s a bit old-fashioned, but is still used sometimes to distinguish between a more rational problem-solving approach (associated with left brain). Versus a more creative, open, and exploring approach (right brain) 2\nI don’t know if this is exactly what Simone Weil meant when she talked about attention. But it feels similar, or at least it feels right to me. \nIf the goal is not to solve problems and find solutions (left brain) but to be present and open to questions (right brain), then it makes sense to practice right brain activity in any way possible.\nSo when someone says that art, drawing, or music can make you a better person- that can mean that exercising your “right brain” builds up the muscles that help you pay attention.\nThis makes me wonder:\n“What kind of activities can work?”\n“Why don’t we do those activities more often?”\n“How does society, church, or institutions make it harder (or easier) to pay attention?”\nHow religion led my attention astray §\nAs a child growing up, I was always attracted to the rituals of the church. I didn’t understand anything back then, but the church represented mystery, ritual, and wonder to me. It was alluring.\nAs I grew up, I wanted to get closer to the church and understand the mystery that enamored me so much as a child. So I tried to study it. I read up books on Catholicism. I went on to become a Theologian.\nBut I realized too late that if you want to kill your love for something, study it. There’s nothing wrong with a little knowledge, but it doesn’t end there.\nIt’s like trying to get to know someone by reading up about them, instead of spending time with them. You can learn a lot, but you won’t really know them until you spend time with them.\nMy experience of Catholicism now is fully left brain. Critical, always thinking, always using my judging mind\nLately, I have been feeling like I am on the inside of the church looking out. I don’t know why, but I find myself feeling like an outsider, like I don’t belong. But at the same time, I cannot just leave. I don’t think it’s that simple. And it is a strange feeling, because the church has always been such a big part of my life.\nIn the spirit of Weil’s attention, I am not rushing to solutions- I am doing my best to work on the problem. Like a math problem that is difficult to solve. And enjoying that puzzle\nWhy I think religion’s role is to cultivate attention §\nOn top of my own problems with attention, it is difficult to stay in the church if I’m really attending to the reality of the world. \nIt feels like what happens in the church, or what church people care about is so small and trivial compared to what is really important and what really matters in everyday life. It’s not even about justice and the poor.\nFor me it’s a left brain vs right brain thing. I used to be a very logical, left-brained apologist. But the rhythms of my life took me to a right brained space. In a sense, I had to unlearn a lot of what I knew in order to find a new way of being in the world.\nThe church feels like it is stuck in the left brain. It is all about doctrine, and rules, and right and wrong. \nI’m not saying that the church is irrelevant, or that it doesn’t have anything to offer. But it feels like it is so caught up in its own world, that it is missing the bigger picture.\nIt’s not just me. I know there are others who feel the same way. We are the ones who are struggling to stay, because we believe in the church, and we want it to be better. But it is hard, when it feels like the church is not really attending to the needs of the world.\n–\nI used to believe that you could study your way into a new way of becoming. Perhaps this is possible. I’ve certainly had ideas and analogies that were so powerful they completely changed the way I think about my world.\nBut most of the time, I think maybe 95% of the time, it is action that precedes thinking and belief. I think that way I think because of the things I do and who I am. We learn through our bodies. It is not abstractly in the mind.\nWe go on nature hikes, and our right brain wakes up- and we learn to see the world this way.\nIt is the difference between a tour vs a pilgrimage.\nIt is the difference between a zoo, a safari, and a mountain hike\nIt is the difference between music criticism and being at a concert.\nThis is what I feel religion is like.\nWhen people say that they feel closer to God in the mountains, or in some far off wild landscape. They’re not being insane.\n–\n\nAnd yes I’m picking on religion because that’s my experience and it’s easy. But all of society has come to feel this way.\nCivic organizations have become less about civics and more about tribalism, a bit of us versus them.\nCountries used to stand for moral things, and the good of society. Now it also feels like an us versus them\nCorporations are the same too- it’s just left-brained profit driven thinking. I think of food and agriculture, I think of reading, I think of writing. I think of universities. It feels like it’s everywhere.\nAnd we’re not saying to remove everything and burn it all to the ground.\nBut it is a need to escape from the tyranny of the left brain, and open things up to a bit of more right brain experiences.\nWhat Would Simone Weil Say About Religion and Society Today? §\nI’ve set it up pretty easy\nShe’d say to pay attention\nAnd to wait and see\nYes I understand how naive this sounds. But hey I never said I was coming in to solve all these problems.\nI’ve just writing what I think, and how I’m going to go about it.\nThe Outside of the Religion: Where Simone Weil Felt She Belonged §\nSimone Weil has the phrase that she feels like she’s in the outside of the church looking in\nI feel like I’m in the opposite place\nWith utter frankness and humility, she positions herself between the inside and the outside. She surprises herself as much as she does us with her unfolding spirituality, her clarity regarding organized religion, and her union with God. At once lofty and down to earth, a (non-official) convert and critic, Weil is a kindred spirit to anyone who embraces the complexity of life on the periphery and receptiveness to the ever evolving mystery of faith.\nReligion and Society on the right side of the brain §\nWhatever I don’t think we can really change society or religion\nBut maybe you can ask- what are those organizations- secular or religion that turn on the right side of my brain.\nThe interest in meditation\nThe hunger for some kind of meaning\nIt all links to this idea for sure\nSimone Weil’s Legacy: On Attention and Living in the World §\nIn Simone Weil’s thought, we need to be ready for the important things that are before us\nWe shall not cease from exploration\nAnd the end of all our exploring\nWill be to arrive where we started\nAnd know the place for the first time.\nT.S.

This creates a cycle of consumption and waste that not only strains our wallets but also the environment.\nTwo ideas captivate me: shopping less and foraging more. It’s a nod to a simpler, more connected way of living. It shifts the focus from mindless consumption to mindful gathering. Shopping “little and often” becomes not just a method but a philosophy. It minimizes waste and maximizes the utility of each purchase, aligning with the principle of living green.\nThe art of foraging, often overlooked, connects us back to the land and makes us participants in our own survival. There’s a sense of accomplishment in finding wild garlic, berries, or even nettles, which are “so underrated,” according to experts.\nThese two practices combined could make for an exciting experiment in sustainable living. They encourage a deeper connection with our environment, and perhaps even with ourselves, as we become more deliberate in our choices.\n\nRead more at: 50 simple ways to make your life greener | Environment | The Guardian\nGo one level up : Homesteading MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Philippines Foraging"},"Notes/Let-grass-grow-for-insects-and-wildlife-(concept)":{"title":"Let grass grow for insects and wildlife (concept)","links":["Notes/How-to-Build-a-Pond"],"tags":[],"content":"Let grass grow for insects and wildlife (concept) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea: §\n\nThis is a new trend in gardening\nThat’s very helpful and is a really good idea\nCreate a beneficial ecosystem\n\nSee also: §\n\nHow to Build a Pond\n"},"Notes/Let-your-subconscious-figure-it-out":{"title":"Let your subconscious figure it out","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Let your subconscious figure it out §\nWatch a video of yourself\nagain and again\nsleep on it\nCome back the next day"},"Notes/Letter-to-clement":{"title":"Letter to clement","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Letter to Clement (in the divine office) §\nto the Corinthians\nThis was the bit about how they were getting chastized\nin the same way that Paul was chastizing them\nSo it’s a story about humans being the same\nAnd not getting frustrated\nBut asking yourself\nWill I break the cycle?\n—\nIt’s just so funny to me"},"Notes/Levels-of-Magnification":{"title":"Levels of Magnification","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","tags/concept","Notes/Refraction-Thinking"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"up:: Thinking MOC\ntags::#concept\nLevels of Magnification §\nAnalyzing a Problem Through Three Different Levels of Magnification\nUse this to define a problem and gain clarity.\nI have found it useful to use three different levels of magnification when looking at some Thing and asking the question:\n“What’s the Problem?”\n\nConceptual (Macro) — This is the high-level perspective, philosophical, theoretical, existential\nPractical (Meso) — No fancy language, just the actual how-to of something\nTechnical (Micro) — The nuts and bolts, diving deep into the specifics of a thing\n\nSee also: Refraction Thinking\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2018-06-18\n\n\n"},"Notes/Leverage-Points--Places-to-Intervene-in-a-System":{"title":"Leverage Points- Places to Intervene in a System","links":["Maps/Health-Mindsets-MOC","Notes/Journeying-Mindset"],"tags":["leverage","coaching","efficiency","change"],"content":"PLACES TO INTERVENE IN A SYSTEM §\n(in increasing order of effectiveness)\n\nConstants, parameters, numbers (subsidies, taxes, standards).\nRegulating negative feedback loops.\nDriving positive feedback loops.\nMaterial flows and nodes of material intersection.\nInformation flows.\nThe rules of the system (incentives, punishments, constraints).\nThe distribution of power over the rules of the system.\nThe goals of the system.\nThe mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, power structure, rules, its culture — arises.\n\nI think people fail to understand this.\nOr the higher up you go, the harder it’s going to be.\nAnd I’d like to make my own version of this for personal fitness and health.\n\nRead more at: Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System -

Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft’s life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time, received more attention than her writing. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.\nDuring her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children’s book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.\nAfter Wollstonecraft’s death, her widower published a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft’s advocacy of women’s equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.\nAfter two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died 11 days after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Shelley, who would become an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein.\nWikipedia\n"},"Notes/Maslow's-hammer-(concept)":{"title":"Maslow's hammer (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Concept: Maslow’s hammer §\nThere’s the quote.\nIf your tool is a hammer\nthen everything looks like a nail\nYou need tools\notherwise you’ll just rely on one framework only\nEverything will look like a nail."},"Notes/Mass-man-and-spiritual-barbarism":{"title":"Mass man and spiritual barbarism","links":["Notes/Why-study-history"],"tags":["-history-on/politics-masses-on/democracy--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nPhilosophize This\nRevolt of the Masses\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62b9603162ce94f7a90e5d7e\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nAll diversity (radical diversity)\nends in fascism\nBecause you allow for the diversity of opinions\nThe mass man imposes a kind of spiritual barbarism in the world around them\n(They impose their stupidity of the world)\nSee also §\nWhy study history"},"Notes/Masterly-Inactivity-in-the-Garden":{"title":"Masterly Inactivity in the Garden","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Masterly Inactivity in the Garden §\nSince we were in Bataan for a month, I had to accept that my plants would probably not make it.

Do you need a strong mind too?\nOf course. Of course. Of course.\nIt’s like only thinking about your health when you’re sick. Obsessing over cures and medicines, but ignoring your health when “things are okay.”\nFor many years, we optimized physical fitness while ignoring mental fitness §\nIn 2017, Kevin Love, a professional basketball player had a panic attack during an NBA game.\nReflecting on that experience:\n\n“In the NBA, you have trained professionals to fine-tune your life in so many areas. Coaches, trainers and nutritionists have had a presence in my life for years. But none of those people could help me in the way I needed when I was lying on the floor struggling to breathe.”\n\nYou can read more about it here: Kevin Love on Mental Health: Everyone Is Going Through Something\nFrom elite athletes to casual exercisers, there’s so much information on how to optimize our bodies\n“These are the best workouts”\n“These are the best diets”\n“This is best pillow and mattress for sleep”\nWe have so many experts on how the body works.\nWhere are the mental fitness experts and coaches?\nHow are you building mental fitness? §\nHow do you work with your saboteurs?\nAll of us have a voice inside that hits us with negative self talk.\nIt tells us we’re not good enough.

Or do you let it take control of your day and hijack you?\nHow are you using your ‘slow brain?’\nMost of the time, we’re thinking in a hyper-rational mode.\nIt’s the kind of thinking that a lot of modern life asks us to do. We have to be critical, rational, always thinking and deciding.\nBut mental fitness comes from a different mode of thinking. One that is more emotional and intuitive.\nA great way to practice this is to do activities that “slow your brain down.”\nWho are you having honest conversations with?\nLast thing that helps a lot is to engage in real honest conversations with people.\nIt can be a close friend, it can be a therapist or a coach, it can be a support group.\nOpen, honest, and vulnerable conversation moves us away from a hyper-rational mode of thinking and builds up our mental fitness."},"Notes/Mental-Squeeze-Point":{"title":"Mental Squeeze Point","links":["Notes/LYT-Kit","tags/pkm","Notes/MOCs-Overview"],"tags":["pkm"],"content":"up:: LYT Kit\ntags::#pkm\nMental Squeeze Point §\nA Mental Squeeze Point is when your unsorted knowledge becomes so messy it overwhelms and discourages you.

Consider it a path you carve out from a dense forest, a journey in which you’ve amassed a treasure trove of wisdom (your “knowledge of 100”). Now, your objective is to create a pathway (your “path of 1”) to guide others. This perspective reframes the process as less of an insurmountable mountain and more of a rewarding journey with relatable milestones.\nHere’s where it gets personal: aim for a product that you yourself need or needed. This principle hones in on the authentic problems that you can solve better than anyone else. Maybe it’s a fitness program that makes exercise fun for people who find working out boring. Or perhaps it’s a course that integrates ‘right-brain activities’ into health coaching.\nIn my own experience, the process of product creation is a crucible for learning and self-discovery. For instance, I discovered the critical balance between challenge and comfort when it comes to fostering change—both in myself and my clients. This hands-on wisdom becomes the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of your offering. It isn’t just some off-the-shelf solution; it’s a system refined by your personal journey, making it inherently valuable and less susceptible to those looking for quick profits.\nIn a world where everyone is rushing to make a quick buck, creating a product that is rooted in your own experiences will not only be more genuine but also more effective. It becomes a self-marketing system, and the journey itself teaches you how to make it better. So, let’s not dread the process; let’s embrace it as a quest with the endgame of not just financial stability but meaningful impact.\n\nRead more at: https://thedankoe.com/letters/why-micro-education-businesses-are-the-future-zero-dollars-to-start/\nGo one level up : Creator Economy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Minimum Lovable Product"},"Notes/Midnight-Mile":{"title":"Midnight Mile","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.tracksmith.com/journal/article/midnight-mile-documentary\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi-(kit)":{"title":"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/on/people","1990---Flow","Notes/Flow"],"tags":["on/people"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#on/people\ndates:: 1934 - 2021\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi §\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi is the author of 1990 - Flow (not included in the LYT Kit).

You just have to believe that the body is anti-fragile and not fragile (we can get stronger after injuries)\nThe resting state of the human body is pain-free. Pain is your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong and needs to be fixed, Starrett says. The sensation can come from an injury or physical impairment (in which case you should talk to your doctor) but it can also result from tissue stiffness, not moving enough, or sitting weirdly.\nStarrett made it clear that you shouldn’t be walking around sore every day. Working in an office shouldn’t leave you hurting. And if it does, it’s a sign that you need to address the problem. Locate the problem, figure out what system it’s a part of, and find an exercise that will help.\nAccording to Kelly Starrett, you shouldn’t be in pain when you press down on your muscles or stretch them out.\nAdditionally, you should be able to breathe comfortably while you’re working on something. If you’re foam rolling and you’re in agony, stop—you’re doing something wrong.\nStarrett explains that moving well and without pain isn’t a game you can win. There’s no point at which you can declare victory and say you’re done; that your knee is totally fixed and you’ll be able to hop, skip, and jump into your 90s. Modern life is always going to throw you curveballs and you’ll need to adapt.\nThat’s interesting because we are getting to a point where people are understanding the importance of always moving.\nThat reminds me of Antifragility and how it applies to the body\nIt’s similar because the body is something that can get stronger over time\nIt’s different because antifragility applies to the mind, but it can also apply to the body\nIt’s important because we need to adapt and not be perfect if we’re going to grow"},"Notes/Move-with-variety---to-get-help-in-individual-parts":{"title":"Move with variety - to get help in individual parts","links":["Movement-is-Medicine"],"tags":["--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nMove Your DNA with Katy Bowman\nEp 132: How Movement Fits Into Intentional Aging\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62c69f4e7de2541f98e42148\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThere needs to be variety in movement\nSo move in as many different ways as you can\nSee also §\nMovement is Medicine"},"Notes/Movement-Evolved-Before-Language":{"title":"Movement Evolved Before Language","links":["Todd-Hargrove","Hand-and-Minds-(Highlights)"],"tags":[],"content":"Movement Evolved Before Language §\nSource §\n\nTodd Hargrove in Hand and Minds (Highlights)\n\nKey Idea §\n\nMovement is more primitive and can tap deeper\n"},"Notes/Movement-and-expressing-yourself-in-different-situations":{"title":"Movement and expressing yourself in different situations","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Movement-and-health-is-about-freedom-as-you-age":{"title":"Movement and health is about freedom as you age","links":["Notes/202112081047--Health-and-Freedom","Notes/202207200813--If-you-could-give-up-half-of-your-money-now-for-health-what-would-it-be"],"tags":["-on/freedom-independence-on/aging-movement--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThe Peter Attia Drive\nThe Art of Stability | Beth Lewis\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62de4ee19280c589ea2a7d15\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nWhen you’re old, the goal is to be able to be independent.

We don’t need to reinvent the wheel.\nWhoop puts out a number\n\nHere’s Garmin’s version of your body score\n\nHeck even Wii Fit had done this\n\nI wanted to make one as a fun little math problem for myself, and to see how I would make something like this also.\nHere’s the Setup §\nEach client’s first session runs them through a basic bodyweight circuit.\n\n30 seconds per movement\n30 seconds rest in between\n2 rounds total\nIt’s on the easier beside because many of the clients are new to working out, and are more of beginners.\n\nThey do 6 movements\n\nSquats\nDeadlifts\nPush Ups\nPlanks\nMountain Climbers\nDownward Dog\n\nFor each movement, record the number of reps or seconds done.\n\nPlay around with the numbers based on form and variation §\nIf I want to get a score out of 100, I’m going to need to add some variety. I’ll do this with some multiplier modifiers.\nFirst thing I can think of is the form. If the client does 30 push ups, but the form is garbage, they should be penalized by that.\nOn the other hand, if they do 20 push ups with perfect form, that should be a bonus. So I come up with this.\n\nThe numbers are arbitary at this point.\nI can also add a modifier for different variations of the movements.\nFor example, a knee push up should be scoring less than a regular push up.\n\nSo I apply a similar transformation.\nBetween form quality and variations I can get 6 modifiers\n\nNot bad. It’s still simple, but can provide enough variation in the results.\nLet’s put that in a table §\n\nIf all exercises used the same table, then 30 pushups done with Great form and a progress would be the bottom right square (which is 43.2)\nThis means that I’ll have to adjust this table based on what I think the ideal number of reps/seconds are for each individual exercise.\nNormalizing it to a score over 100 §\nI was thinking about how to transform this into a function out of 100.\nI played around with the idea of normal distribution. Since the amount of reps a person can do should fall somewhere within the population distribution. In the end, it didn’t make sense because I don’t think I’m comparing people to their level within the population (?) I’m not sure about this and need to think some more.\nSo I tried a different approach.\nSome things I wanted\n\nI want the bottom right square of the matrix to score 100 (ideal # of reps / ideal form / ideal progression)\nI want the graph to slope up fast and plateau (which is the experience of building a skill)\n\nSo it needs to look something like this.\n\nIn the end, I (arbitrarily) chose a sigmoid function of the form\n\nwhich gives me the shape I want\nI messed around with numbers and I ended up with\n\nwhich starts at 0 and goes up to 100\nI chose for a=0.08 and b=1.05. Unfortunately, those are numbers I also just came up with through trial and error.\nShifting a affects the overall number of reps\nSo for example, if I made a=0.1 then it would take LESS reps to score higher\nconversely, if a=0.01 then you’d need MORE reps to score higher\nShifting b affects the bend in the curve. (i.e. how steep newbie gains are // or how early you plateau)\nIf I made b=1.1 then lower reps would score higher (with a minimal effects on higher reps)\nIf b=1.01 then the graph starts to look more linear\nSo here’s what I end up with\n\nMore Thoughts §\nI think I’d like the formulas to be less arbitrary, but for now I think it works.\nI’d need a unique table per exercise, but it’s a good start to getting a score out of 100 for each of the 6 exercises based on the number of reps they can do.\n\nRead more at: How to balance measureables and actual healthcare\nYou may also be interested in: Data has killed our intuition"},"Notes/My-Virtues":{"title":"My Virtues","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC"],"tags":["-virtues-","-principles-"],"content":"\n“Where attention goes, meaning grows.”\n\nThat means, just by thinking of a virtue, you may just start to live more in line with it.\n\nJoy, Awe, and Wonder: Smile, laugh, grin.

I just walked out and went.\nToday, my play is more like\npilgrimage.\nI’ll walk around with some vague destination in mind. But I have no qualms about walking through random fields and stopping at random places.\nI really like that Morong pilgrimage I did (one of the last ones before all this).

I wonder if that kills it in the first place. Like by designating. Okay, now I’m going to play for the next two hours.

But this art is usually laughably ugly, made by a bot who can generate millions of soulless pieces of art.\n\nAlso, someone could just right click and save a piece of generated art, making the ‘non-fungible’ part questionable. Remember, the NFT is only a receipt, even if the art it links to is generated off an ID in the receipt.\n\n\n\nhowever, NFTs are marketed as if they’re selling you the art itself, which they’re not. This is rightly called out by just about everybody. You can decentralize receipts because those are small and plain-text (inexpensive to log in the blockchain), but that art needs to be hosted somewhere. If the server where art is hosted goes down, your art is gone.\n\n\nNFT minters are often art thieves, minting others’ work and trying to spin a profit. The anonymous nature of NFTs makes it hard to crack down on, and moderation is poor in NFT communities.\n\n\nArtists who get into NFTs with a sincere hope of making money are often hit with a harsh reality that they’re losing more money to minting NFTs of their art is making in profit. (Each individual minted art piece costs about 70−100 USD to mint)\n\n\nmost huge sales are actually the seller selling it to themselves under a different wallet, to try to grift others into thinking the token is worth more than it is. Wallet IDs are not tied to names and therefore are anonymous enough to encourage drumming up fake hype.\n\n\nexample: If you mint a piece of art, that art is worth (technically speaking) zero dollars until someone buys it for a price.

Buying a digital hat for your character is only worth anything because of artificial scarcity and bragging rights. NFTs bolster both of those\n\n\nThe computational cost of minting NFTs (and verifying blockchain technology on the whole) is very energy intensive, and until our power grids are run with renewables, this means we’re burning more coal, more fossil fuels, so that more grifters can grift artists and investors.\n\n\nHope this explains. You’re correct that the tone is very anti-NFT. Unfortunately the answer is complicated and made of tons of issues.

It sneaks up on you, often undermining your body’s natural cooling mechanisms and putting you at risk for heat-related illnesses. Unlike dry heat, where the rules of engagement are relatively straightforward, humidity necessitates more nuanced strategies.\nThink of humidity as the “rope bridge” of climate challenges—it might not look as daunting as a chasm, but it requires careful and intentional navigation. Living in the Philippines, I often find the humidity to be an invisible wall, affecting not just how I exercise but also how my body recovers and adapts.\nWhen tackling this issue, it’s akin to addressing a complex system where the interventions need to be holistic rather than isolated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer a baseline approach: stay indoors with air conditioning, hydrate, and pace your outdoor activities. However, the key adjustment for humid climates like ours is speeding up “exposure reduction interventions.” Translation: take action faster than you would in a dry climate.\nIf you find yourself outdoors, timing is crucial. Early morning or late evening workouts are advisable to avoid the peak humidity levels that typically occur during midday. For those who have the flexibility, seeking air-conditioned or naturally cooler environments for activities like reading or mindfulness practices can make a considerable difference in overall well-being.\nIt’s not merely about combating humidity; it’s about adapting to it. While the weather might not be within our control, our responses to it are. Navigating the humid labyrinth requires us to be proactive, prepared, and, most importantly, aware. By doing so, we not only protect our health but also improve the quality of our lives in these challenging climates.\n\nRead more at: When Does Humidity Become Dangerous to Your Health?\nGo one level up : Climate MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Understand that seasons are different in the Philippines (idea concept)"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Curse-of-Knowledge--Crafting-Effective-Introductions":{"title":"Navigating the Curse of Knowledge- Crafting Effective Introductions","links":["Maps/networking-MOC","Notes/Counter-the-bystander-effect-with-a-Directly-Responsible-Individual"],"tags":["communication","startup","knowledge","curse-of-knowledge","messaging"],"content":"Introductions, whether they are in the form of emails, presentations, or conversations, have a crucial role in communication. Yet, it’s all too easy to fall victim to the “curse of knowledge,” a concept famously discussed by C.S. Lewis.\nThis curse occurs when individuals, well-versed in a particular subject, forget that their audience doesn’t share the same level of familiarity. In the realm of startups and business interactions, it’s vital to overcome this cognitive hurdle.\nThe key lies in providing context. A well-crafted introduction should offer enough information about yourself or your startup so that the recipient grasps the purpose and significance of your message. Omitting essential context can lead to confusion and misinterpretation, forcing the recipient to fill in the gaps or, worse, discard your message altogether.\nAdditionally, highlighting what makes your startup unique is a powerful way to pique the recipient’s interest. Clearly articulating your value proposition sets the stage for a more meaningful and engaging interaction.\nMoreover, consider the medium of your introduction. Attachments, such as presentation decks, summaries, or screenshots, can enhance understanding and make your message more compelling.\nIn essence, the art of introductions is about transcending the curse of knowledge. It’s about ensuring that your message is not lost in translation, but rather, it resonates with your audience, inviting them to connect and engage with your ideas and offerings.\n\nRead more at: Introductions and the “forward intro email” | by Roy Bahat | Also by Roy Bahat\nGo one level up : networking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Counter the bystander effect with a Directly Responsible Individual"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Data-Quagmire--The-Paradox-of-Wearable-Tech":{"title":"Navigating the Data Quagmire: The Paradox of Wearable Tech","links":["Maps/Data-MOC","Notes/The-problem-with-tracking-and-wearables"],"tags":["wearables","data-analysis","data","health-coaching","mindfulness"],"content":"Wearable technology, with its flashy dashboards and real-time metrics, promises a utopia of self-knowledge. However, the article “A Framework to Make Better Use of Wearables Data” cracks open the myth of continuous tracking as an unequivocal good. The lure of data can often become a labyrinth, trapping you in an endless cycle of quantification without meaningful context.\nHere’s a hard truth: Optical technology, the backbone of most wearables, isn’t as reliable as we’d like to think. This becomes glaringly apparent when our bodies are in motion. Suddenly, the heart rate monitor acts like a compass in the Bermuda Triangle—wayward, and highly prone to error. For me, this underlines the critical importance of context and timing when interpreting data.\nSo, why the fascination with 24/7 monitoring? Is it genuinely beneficial, or is it a sleight of hand to keep us engaged with the device? Data for the sake of data is an empty endeavor. It’s like obsessing over the metrics of your business without understanding what those numbers actually mean for its health and growth. The notion that wearables offer a holistic view of our wellbeing is an attractive but misleading narrative.\nThe article recommends a more mindful approach—spot checks in the morning or continuous monitoring only during sleep. This method may not shower you with data, but what you do collect is likely more useful. Why? Because it’s data that can be meaningfully interpreted.\nLet’s recalibrate our perspective on wearable tech. Continual monitoring isn’t inherently useful; meaningful data is. Just like in entrepreneurship, it’s not about having all the data but knowing which data matters. It’s about precision, not abundance.\n\nRead more at: A framework to make better use of Wearables data\nGo one level up : Data MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The problem with tracking and wearables"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Labyrinth-of-Mind-Traps":{"title":"Navigating the Labyrinth of Mind Traps","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/Building-up-your-mental-fitness"],"tags":["cognitive-bias","mindfulness","self-awareness","imposter-syndrome"],"content":"Mind traps can be seen as the “quicksand” of our mental landscapes—treacherous areas where you find yourself sinking in a whirlpool of unproductive thoughts. These traps manifest differently for everyone, but the commonality lies in their ability to distort our perspective, often without us even realizing it.\nWhen you’re navigating this maze, think of yourself as a labyrinth explorer—outfitted not with a sword and shield, but with the weapons of self-awareness and mindfulness. For me, imposter syndrome is one of those traps. It’s like entering a hall of mirrors, where every reflection whispers that I’m not good enough, not “real” enough. This experience can be suffocating, pulling you deeper into the maze.\nThe trick is not merely to identify these traps, but to name them. It’s like a spell that reduces their power. Recognize them as distortions, not as your reality. When I realize I’m under the spell of imposter syndrome, I have to tell myself, “This is not me. This is a distortion of my abilities and worth.”\nConsider the following:\n\nDo you often find yourself looping through the same thoughts, akin to a hamster on a wheel?\nAre you narrowly focusing on elements that are mere fragments of the entire picture, like looking at a forest but only seeing one or two trees?\n\nIdentifying and naming these mind traps is akin to discovering secret passages in the labyrinth, shortcuts that help you escape or, at the very least, mitigate the trap’s effects. It’s crucial, not just for your mental wellbeing, but also for your interpersonal relationships and professional growth.\nIt’s not about eliminating mind traps entirely—that’s as futile as trying to smooth out a crumpled paper to perfection. It’s about recognizing their presence and navigating them strategically, almost like a sailor tacking against the wind. This approach enables you to shift your focus, gain perspective, and move towards a more balanced and self-aware existence.\n\nRead more at: 10 common mind traps and how to break free — Groov | Workplace Mental Wellbeing Platform\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Building up your mental fitness"},"Notes/Navigating-the-Metagame--Lessons-from-Academia-to-Entrepreneurship":{"title":"Navigating the Metagame- Lessons from Academia to Entrepreneurship","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/poem-experience-and-knowledge"],"tags":["academia","entrepreneurship","meta-game","metagame","interaction","discourse"],"content":"In the world of expertise and professional pursuits, there exists a phenomenon known as “The Expert Problem,” as articulated by Nassim Taleb. It’s a situation where experts and meta-experts pass judgment on the work of other experts. Over time, this detachment from the practical realities of a field can lead to corruption and dysfunction. In academic circles, this has manifested as the replication crisis and the often perplexing intricacies of the humanities.\nJavier’s journey provides a compelling case study in this regard. His academic background exposed him to a world rich in intellectual discourse and jargon, where conferences and discussions on the latest trends in the field were commonplace. While this environment had its merits and was undeniably intellectually stimulating, it also raised a fundamental question: “What was he truly accomplishing?”\nThe allure of academia often lies in the cerebral discussions and theoretical explorations, but for someone like Javier, the desire to make a tangible impact in the world tugged at his ambitions. The metagame, with its focus on discussing and opining rather than “doing the job,” left him seeking a more hands-on and results-driven path.\nThis realization led him to entrepreneurship, where the landscape is markedly different. Entrepreneurship is firmly grounded in practicality. It’s about taking action, solving real-world problems, and building something from the ground up. It’s an on-the-ground endeavor that demands tangible results, often in stark contrast to the academic world’s propensity for abstract debates.\nJavier’s transition from academia to entrepreneurship represents a shift from the metagame to the game itself, where action takes precedence over discourse. It’s a testament to his desire to be actively engaged in making a difference and creating a meaningful impact on people’s lives.\n\nRead more at: Beware the Metagame\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: poem experience and knowledge"},"Notes/Ness-Labs-Creative-Hour":{"title":"Ness Labs Creative Hour","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"How do I feel about being a creator?\nResponsibility\nWhat is the difference between a creator and an artist, a freelancer, an entrepreneur, and an influencer?\nI feel like they are different things on the creator scale.\nI could rank them perhaps?\nLike an artist has the least concern over money\nThen the creator\nand then the freelancer\nand then the entrepreneur\nThe influencer doesn’t seem to really fit in this paradigm.\nI think of myself as both a creator and an entrepreneur\n\nThe creator side is me\n\nIt’s my thoughts and my ideas\nIt’s my experiences\nIt’s how I put my own thoughts together in health\nHow I combine everything together\n\n\nThe entrepreneur side is the business\n\nI think right now there is systems that need to get into place\nLike background stuff to make it cleaner\nsystems and products\nBut it all flows from the creator\n\n\n\nThe creator has ideas,\nand combines his experiences in some really interesting ways.\nand then thinks of things he would like to do\nmake products\nor help people\nThe creator used to be a teacher, and that’s why the creator likes to just go and do things\n\nThe entrepreneur is thinking of systems and building things\n\nWhy do some people want to become a creator, and not others?\nThat’s a good question\nIt’s risky\nI think there was a financial incentive for sure\nI wanted the freedom\nThe ability to be with my wife\nBut when I think about it, it wasn’t so easy\nbecause I wasn’t making enough money anyway\nSo when I reflect on my own experience—\nit’s because of the pandemic\nand the freedom that came with that experience\nthat really allowed me to see how nice it is to balance time at home with work and fulfilling projects\nThis was balance that I’ve never had before.\nMaybe some people are already quite comfortable with work\nand they’ve found the stability- and they’re completely okay with that.\nThere are other ways to be creative— without being a creator.\nI can imagine if you have a stable job, and enough free time, then you can be creative in different ways.\nPeople really do have to express themselves creatively.\nAnd there are so many different ways to do that.\nFor me, because of the nature of my work— it’s not going to be convenient.

Her music spanned styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&amp;B, gospel and pop.\nThe sixth of eight children born to a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well received audition, which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree.To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to “Nina Simone” to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play “the devil’s music” or so-called “cocktail piano”. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with “I Loves You, Porgy”. Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.\nWikipedia\n"},"Notes/Nine-Trends-That-Will-Shape-Our-Careers-in-2021":{"title":"Nine Trends That Will Shape Our Careers in 2021","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Nine Trends That Will Shape Our Careers in 2021 §\nSource: §\n\nhttps://junglegym.substack.com/p/nine-trends-that-will-shape-our-careers-in-2021\n\nKey Ideas: §\n\nWellness culture is going to be very important\n- Over the past year, organizations across every industry have started thinking about how to promote employee well-being.\n"},"Notes/No-Child-Left-Behind-(Example)":{"title":"No Child Left Behind (Example)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"No Child Left Behind (example) §\nThe problems of\nStandardised Testing\nYou attach funding to results\nYou’re going to see people mess up the results.\nSee also §\nGoodhart’s Law"},"Notes/No-history-no-gratitude-are-fascists":{"title":"No history no gratitude are fascists","links":["Notes/The-masses-are-the-spoiled-child-of-modern-democracy"],"tags":["-history-on/democracy-fascism-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nPhilosophize This\nRevolt of the Masses\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62b9603162ce94f7a90e5d64\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThey have no sense of history\nWeild technology that took years to produce\nwithout appreciation of where it comes from\nThese people resemble fascists\nSee also §\nLouis CK on airplanes\nThe masses are the spoiled child of modern democracy"},"Notes/No-you're-not-lazy--life-is-really-hard":{"title":"No you're not lazy- life is really hard","links":["Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/Setting-motivation-For-lifelong-goals","tags/motivation","tags/on/challenge","Notes/202112181555--imperfect-motivation"],"tags":["motivation","on/challenge"],"content":"up:: Health MOC\nX:: Setting motivation For lifelong goals\ntags::#motivation#on/challenge\nnovelty:: 3\nLink to Reference §\nurl: No Motivation To Do Anything?

It’s essentially Freud’s Id.\nHandling No-Face §\nDo Not Engage! — When the primal part of people take over, it’s like they become No-Face. Do not perpetuate the aggression No-Face feeds off of. No-Face is best deflated by choosing not to respond aggressively (ie, sinking to its level), but rather by calling upon your reserves of discipline to enter a mindset of restraint and non-reaction; benevolence and patience—with an eye towards the well-being of the attacker while still holding your own.\nIn this way, you are not feeding the libido, but letting itself wear itself out. Just as No-Face’s aggressions are dissipated by Chihiro in Spirited Away.\nThere is an art to handling self-perpetuating aggressiveness.\nLook to Aikido for more insights into deflecting and dissipating an attacker’s energy.\nRelated §\n| Aikido | The Id |\n(previous thoughts: is organum indifferent, neither good nor evil; an emotion mirror, it becomes its environment)"},"Notes/Norm-Macdonalds-show":{"title":"Norm Macdonalds show","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Norm Macdonalds Show\nNorm Macdonald Live : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive"},"Notes/North-Star-(concept)":{"title":"North Star (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"North Star (concept) §\nThis is about a fixed point\nYour goal\nFor exploration"},"Notes/Not-everything-needs-a-moral":{"title":"Not everything needs a moral","links":[],"tags":["-art-morality-wokeness-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nalicegribbin.substack.com\nThe Empathy Racket\nurl: https://alicegribbin.substack.com/p/the-empathy-racket\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nThe empath and the activist regard art fundamentally as a delivery system for messages and awarenesses.

I’ve parlayed hard-earned patterns in one field of thought—systematizing and maintaining a small business—into a completely different one—like editing in television.\nA large part of this ability stems from not just having quality experiences in my life, but in being able to re-apply fundamental aspects of those past experiences to new situations.\nFor a collection of related odes, check out the Benefits of linked thinking.\nAlso related is how Most PKM educators skip note-making to focus on external rewards.

It doesn’t just stop at humanizing our worries; it parentally nurtures them, cultivating gardens of tomatoes, cilantro, and carrots, as if to feed the next generation of frets and fears. It’s a bit like a fractal, where anxiety produces more anxiety in a never-ending cycle.\nHerein lies a paradox: we can become caretakers of our anxieties, so much so that we create an environment for them to flourish. While this may sound counterintuitive, acknowledging our anxieties as an integral part of us could be the first step in managing them. Think of it as selective gardening: it’s okay to allow certain “plants” to grow while diligently pruning others. Being this garden’s caretaker gives us some level of control.

But this instinct can often do more harm than good in the long run.\nWhen we tense up to protect an injury, we’re preventing our body from full healing. The muscles and tissues around the injury tighten up, which can lead to further damage and pain. \nThis isn’t only true of the body- it’s true of the mind as well.\nThis is Anne Lamott’s quote:\n“Our psychic muscles can cramp around our wounds- the pain from our childhood, the losses and disappointments of adulthood, the humiliations suffered in both- to keep us from getting hurt in the same place again, to keep foreign substances out. So these wounds never have a chance to heal.”\nAnd a physical injury- pulling a muscle- breaking a bone- tearing a ligament is like that. \nThere is physical hurt which we tense up and over protect. But there’s also mental hurt, which makes us over anxious, too careful, and prone to avoidance.\n–\nFear fear everywhere\nThe modern world makes this problem even worse.\nAll around us is a world that makes you feel more and more afraid.\nI don’t know what it is, but it feels like the world has become a scarier and harsher place. It feels like I’m always worried, anxious, and afraid about something. My body is in a perpetual fight or flight mode.\nMaybe it’s the news, maybe it’s social media, I don’t know for sure.\nBut it’s exhausting and it takes a toll on my mental and physical health. \nI’m not the only one feeling this way. \nAccording to a recently study anxiety and depression are on the rise. One that shocked me was that anger was on the rise too! People are more hot-headed than they used to be.\nWhatever the reason, it’s clear that it affects our mind. And that affects our bodies and its ability to recover too.\n–\nLet me share a quick story with you.\nWhen I was a teenager, I injured my shoulder on the trampoline. I used to be a fearless daredevil. That day, I wanted to try a new trick on the trampoline. I did a risky flip, missed the landing, fell off and dislocated my shoulder.\nMy mind didn’t help me then. (Remember pain has its place)\nBut since then, I’m always worried for my shoulders since then. I never found the same confidence and I would avoid moving it. \nI wore protective braces. I held back all the time.\nWhat finally got me feeling safe was talking to a coach. He saw me holding back and said “Hey, you saw your doctor. You did your exercises. You are okay! Don’t let you mind hold you back.”\nAnd he’s right, I’m doing the right exercises, I shouldn’t move as if I was afraid.\nThat did a lot to dispel the fear and uncertainty.\nBut it was easier said than done.\nMy coach helped me intercept the fear, because in my own head I was running away with it- and it was taking me to a bad place.\n–\nWhat I learned there is that on my own, I can get stuck in fear and uncertainty. I needed someone else- like a coach, a doctor, or a mentor- to reassure that things were okay.\nThat’s my secret to all the fear around us.\nSociety now always makes us feel afraid. 24/7 news. Natural disasters. Googling your symptoms. Information Overload. Constant notifications.\nSo it’s no surprise that our minds are always on fight or flight mode.\nAnd to tell you the truth, this affects your body too. The mind affects the body.\nSo what can we do about it? How can we deal with the fear?\nMy first step is to find ways to intercept the fear- and cut it off.\n–\nWhen you are trying to recover from your injuries, and get back into action, you need to intercept your fears. \nOur first instinct tends to be more information. We believe that if we have the right knowledge, we won’t be so afraid. And while that is true, it doesn’t help as much as me think.\nWhat is more effective is to take action.\nAnd I want to do a simple activity with you to take one small step.\nIf you’ll indulge me now- whatever you’re doing, if you’re listening to this while at work, or on the move- if you can take 1 minute to set things aside and be with me here.\nWe’ll do a quick exercise to accept that fear as an emotion.\n(What is the feeling: I’ll never feel better again)\nTake 5 deep breaths and feel your fear.\nIf it helps, project yourself feeling afraid on a movie screen in your mind. See yourself feeling afraid.\nAfter that scene plays out, now imagine yourself taking action, and being brave with your body. What might that look like right now?\nThis doesn’t mean that you have to like your fears or that you have to stay in fight or flight mode all the time. But it does mean that you can acknowledge your fears as a feeling. And then after that- choose to focus on recovery.\nRemember that when we are trying to recover from an injury, our bodies can get stuck in fight or flight mode.\nSo instead of trying to fight our fears, we need to accept and intercept them. §\nRemember, recovering from injury is about improving your health and quality of life.\nYou’re not trying to force yourself or put yourself in danger.\nIf you imagine some action you can take today that makes you feel a bit braver and less afraid- give it a go.\nYou don’t have to avoid all physical activity. But always be mindful of the risks involved and use this exercise to manage it well.\nThe key is to find an activity that you enjoy to help you manage how you feel about it.**"},"Notes/Overcoming-Imposter-Syndrome":{"title":"Overcoming Imposter Syndrome","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/On-Imposter-Syndrome"],"tags":["-imposter-syndrome-","-mission-","-vocation","-work"],"content":"Seth Godin’s ideas on being an imposter\n\n“You feel that way because you are an imposter.

They’re chasing after some birds and suddenly they trip and fall flat. Do you what most kids will do before reacting? They’ll look for the mom or dad and try to read their face.\nIt’s so interesting! Instead of reacting to the pain, they look for their parents for information. \nIf their parents look worried and afraid, and rush over to the kid saying “OMG, are you okay? That was so bad!” Then the kid will start crying, and they’ll link the falling down to something bad and negative.\nBut if their parents look calm, and say “Hey buddy, that’s okay- you’re alright.” The pain is still there, but it’s not something scary and worrying. That kid might even get up and keep playing.\nThe parents’ response to their child’s fall affects how the child will understand pain. \nThat means pain is also learned in a contextual kind of way.\nWe think of pain as an isolated physical experience. It’s about how it feels in my body. But pain is also a social experience. How we interact with people when we’re in pain affects our recovery.\nThis might sound weird but pain is something that we learn.\nWe learn how to respond to pain, both emotionally and physically, from the people around us. \nWhen we’re young, we learn about pain from our parents. We see how they react to our injuries, and we learn how to react to pain from their example.\nPain is a social experience, and it’s one that we learn from the people around us.\nAnd we continue to learn about pain throughout our lives. \n–\nLet me tell you a story about two different doctors.\nIt was 2010 when I tore my ACL playing basketball. I was so afraid that was it for me. I had hurt myself, and I would never be as strong again. I went in to see a doctor, who told me that I needed surgery. So I agreed, I went into it. When I woke up from surgery the doctor told me:\n“Hey you’re up- The surgery was great, your knee is now better than new.”\nI was so relieved and grateful. And I went on to get back to my sports and hobbies.\nIt’s been 10 years since my injury, and I’m still playing sports and enjoying my activities. \nI’m so grateful to the doctor who helped me get better and gave me the confidence to move again.\nNow for Doctor #2, \nAt the start of 2020, the year of covid, I started having some nerve pain going down my arm. This was a new and unfamiliar injury, so I wanted to make sure it was nothing serious.\nLike last time, I went to see a doctor. She did some tests and then told me:\n“You’ve got a pinched nerve. We can treat it, but it’s also going to keep coming back again and again and again.”\nThat was not reassuring, and actually quite scary. I didn’t know what I could do.\nAnd it turned out to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. \nI got more worried, more stressed, and more anxious. That made my body more tense and tight. Which made my nerve pain worse!\nToday, in 2022, I’ve learned a lot about pain since then. And while I know I can work on my mindset to deal with it- I had to suffer a lot of fear, worry, and anxiety- which made my pain worse\nThe doctor’s words put in my mind a broken and irreparable body- and that has sunk into my subconscious.\nIt’s only in the last year that I’m learning that I can deal with it well.\nAnd that’s what I’m doing now. I’m still living with some nerve pain, but I’m also practicing the right mindset.\nI’m doing things that make me happy, and I’m surrounded by people who support me in that journey.\nIf you’re stuck in an injury, I hope these stories give you something to think about.\n–\nA key factor in successful recovery from injury is having someone you can trust. It may be a doctor, coach, spouse, or friend.\nIn simple words, it is having someone in your corner who understands your challenges. You feel comfortable sharing about your recovery. You trust that they will help you through it.\nIt’s someone who will be there for you when you need support and who will help you stay on track when things get tough.\nThere’s a term in recovery called the “therapeutic alliance”\nThis is a special bond that forms between a coach, or a doctor and client. It’s based on trust, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to your recovery. \nResearch has shown that the quality of the therapeutic alliance is one of the most important predictors of successful treatment outcomes.\nIn other words, finding a doctor or coach that you can trust and who has a strong therapeutic alliance with you is a big part of the recovery process. \nSo if you’re looking for someone to help you on your journey to recovery, make sure to find someone who meets these criteria.\n—\nRemember, pain is a social experience. That means the people around you do have a big impact on your health.\nIf your family and friends are always worried for your injury- and they keep telling you to take it easy and to not move around. This can reinforce the subconscious belief that you’re not supposed to move at all.\nThat can keep you stuck in an injury mindset and make it harder for you to recover.\nBut if the people around you are supportive and don’t act worried, it can make a big difference. They help you believe that your recovery is on track, and that you can trust your body again.\nThey can help you stay positive and motivated. It reminds you that you’re capable of overcoming this hurdle.\nSo if you’re stuck in an injury, don’t isolate yourself. \nMake sure you’re surrounded by people who understand what you’re going through and who can offer you the right environment to get through it.\n–\nGive this time, and start to explore.\nTrust is not something that comes right away.\nYou’re always looking for someone who knows what you’ve been through. They may have seen many patients. They may have gone through an injury themselves.\nFinding someone who understands can be a challenge.\nBut it’s not impossible.\nYou might already have people in mind when it comes to trust. They might not be doctors or physical therapists, but remember! It is just as important to feel safe, calm, and trusting.

I think it’s about the mindset you have §\nSometimes when I’m going on a long walk, I have a lot on my mind. Even though I think of hiking as play, if I’m in a place of stress and anxiety, it doesn’t feel relaxing. It feels like a chore.\nI’ve definitely gone on hikes where I was just putting one foot in front of the other and NOT enjoying myself at all.\nOn the other hand, I’ve been at the gym where I’m so present and in the zone. I am aware of each movement. I start noticing my body and muscles in ways I did not before. I start to feel relaxed and curious.\nThat definitely is play for to me.\nOther times, when I’m at the gym- I’m so present and completely aware of each of my movements. I start noticing things in my muscles that I didn’t before. I feel present and curious!\nThat’s more like play.\nEvery movement, every activity can be play- if you bring the right attention to it.\nThe 3 ways that I practice play §\nWhen was the last time you moved because you wanted to? Just for its own sake?\nWe can get caught up in the benefits of exercise, that it starts to feel like a chore- and not something that I want to do.\nHow can I make a movement playful more myself?\n1. Setting aside play time §\nThe best way to give my mind the space to play is to commit to a set time.\nIt can be 15 minutes, it can be 1 hour. Either way, I tell myself\n“These 15 minutes are just to play. No phones. No work. Nothing else but this”\nThat way when I’m playing, I get to be fully present. I’m not really worried about what I need to do next- or where I have to go. I can just set a timer, start playing and just immerse myself in it.\nAnd when the alarm sounds I can go back to my work\n2. ‘Sensing’ my Activity §\nMy mind is always racing around- thinking about what needs to be done next.\nSo I practice play by trying to sense everything there is about my activity.\nIf I’m lifting weights, I might ask:\n“How do the weights feel in my hand?”\n“What textures do I notice on the gym equipment?”\nIf I’m going for swim, I’ll notice:\n“Is the water hot or cold?”\n“What do I taste when I’m immersed?”\n“What sounds do I notice when I’m underwater?”\nThese kinds of questions snap me back to what I’m doing. And it helps me get into a play state of mind.\n3. Using Creativity and Curiosity §\nI also like to mess around. (As long as I know it’s safe)\nWhen I’m playing, I’ll build on what I’m sensing and I’ll see what I can change.\nFor example, if I’m hiking I might say:\n“What if I close my eyes for a few seconds”\n“What if I walk backwards? What if I add a little skip to my step?”\n“What if I notice the unevenness of the ground?”\nIf I’m doing pushups, I might try:\n“What if I position my hands differently?&quot;&quot;\n“Can I do it? Does it feel safe? Does it change the exercise?”\n“Is it easier or harder? What am I learning about my body?”\nThese little things keep my mind in the zone. And let me discover new things about my body or my environment. It’s not just the same each time.\n\nRead more at: URL\nGo one level up : Health Mindsets MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Play, Movement, and Morality"},"Notes/Play-mind-does-different-things-than-the-productive-mind":{"title":"Play mind does different things than the productive mind","links":["Notes/My-experience-of-play"],"tags":[],"content":"Play mind does different things than the productive mind §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey Idea §\n\nIn companies you have to protect your play mind from your productive mind\nIf you’re exploring, you have to stop yourself from feeling too critical.\nIf you’re always editing yourself, you won’t be able to just be creative.\nProtect your play mind from your productive mind.\n\nSee also §\nMy experience of play"},"Notes/Play-vs-a-game":{"title":"Play vs a game","links":["Notes/Games-that-let-you-explore"],"tags":["-on/play-game-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nJarlo Ilano\nBetter movement podcast\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62a199063f707348d6175b02\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nReasons for play\nParkour and play\nPlay is\nA game vs play\nA game is about winning and trying to succeed\nand play is for the sake of\nSee also §\nGames that let you explore"},"Notes/Play-works-a-lot-to-build-elite-athletes":{"title":"Play works a lot to build elite athletes","links":["Notes/Post-Athlete-life-almost-always-reverts-to-mean"],"tags":["-track-and-field-athletics-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nDavid Epstein\nI Object to “Gladwell’s Law”\nurl: https://davidepstein.bulletin.com/my-take-on-gladwell-s-law-that-elite-athletic-achievement-comes-at-the-expense-of-mass-participation/\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nso I feel obliged to point out that the Jamaican sprint factory is powered by youth “sports days” at school where literally everyone tries sprinting in an atmosphere geared toward fun.

To have enough money that they can stop thinking about it and focus on other stuff. (View Highlight)\nA lot of financial planners I’ve talked to say one of their biggest challenges is getting clients to spend money in retirement. Even an appropriate, conservative amount of money. Frugality and savings become such a big part of some people’s identity that they can’t ever switch gears. (View Highlight)\nThat’s interesting because I think about health also and how people think health is for its own sake. But you have to learn how to spend your health too.\nSo you have certain windows and opportunities.\nBoth to spend your money and to move your body\nBecause at some point it just doesn’t really become possible anymore.\nSo for example, for me, I hike when I can. I want to work and farm because my body is able to do that now. It’s not a project that I can do when I retire. It’s something that I can do now, and so I should build my life around my ability to do so.\nThat reminds me of Financial wealth is just as important as physical health\nIt’s similar because it’s the same. People think as wealth and as health as ends in themselves when it’s really not.\nIt’s different because you don’t spend health in the same way. It doesn’t just disappear.

In the optometry office, they call this device a Phoropter. For the purposes of thinking, we’ll call this technique spending time in “Refraction-based thinking”.\n“Refraction” has a different goal than “action”. Refraction is for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Action is about getting things done. Both are essential. Too much refraction and you fall into Hamlet’s trap, who even though he knew his uncle murdered his father, procrastinated from decisive action because of “paralysis by analysis”.\nApplying “refraction” to our thinking is similar to applying a “mental model”, but they tend to stand apart because of the purpose. While Refraction is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding, the use of “Mental Models” is primarily for pattern recognition for efficient, optimal action. The answer here is quite simply to find a balance. (See: Yin and Yang)\nWhen spending time in Refraction Mode, each lens you hold up offers a different view; some more valuable than others, all part of the process.\nWhat is Refraction? Refraction is the turning or bending of any wave, such as a light or sound wave, when it passes from one medium into another of different optical density.\nSome Lenses for Refraction §\n\nThe 7 Dimensions of Wellness\nThe 4 Stoic Virtues\nThe 8-Fold Path\nMy Virtues\n"},"Notes/Regression-to-the-mean-(concept)":{"title":"Regression to the mean (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Regression to the mean in fitness §\nThings will always try to go back to the midpoint.\nSo any kind of progression journey\nWill be more of spike then taper\nor even regress a little"},"Notes/Reid-Hamilton-Fitness":{"title":"Reid Hamilton Fitness","links":["2022-06-16"],"tags":[],"content":"highlights §\n2022-06-16 §\nFollow him on Twitter\nand grabbed these links from his ecosystem\nhttps://mailchi.mp/a173090390ac/ooi8wqz819\nhttps://mailchi.mp/15b9a6cf835b/q5dnfldml3\nStudy and see how he does it"},"Notes/Reimagining-the-Fridge--A-Small-Scale-Approach-to-Waste-Management":{"title":"Reimagining the Fridge: A Small Scale Approach to Waste Management","links":["Food-MOC","Notes/Consumers-Want-Healthier-Food,-Even-if-it-Costs-More"],"tags":["sustainability","efficiency","waste-management","home-management","homesteading"],"content":"Often, when we think of reducing waste and increasing efficiency, we default to big, flashy innovations or lifestyle changes. However, the little highlight from “How to Organize Your Fridge So Food Keeps Longer — and Your Energy Bill Works Harder” serves as a reminder that sometimes, profound impacts start in the nooks and crannies of everyday life—like the shelves of your fridge.\nThe fridge is often underestimated as a potential wasteland. We shove things in, forget about them, and voila! One moldy cucumber later, we’re throwing stuff out. But what if we looked at the fridge not just as a cooling unit but as a control center for waste management? Here’s the game plan: Organize that “bad boy” in sections. Use your fridge doors for foods that can take the temperature fluctuations like a champ—your condiments, juices, etc. Contrary to popular habit, eggs and dairy shouldn’t sit there; they need a cooler sanctuary.\nRemember the phrase, “Ketchup isn’t eternal”? I love it; it adds a sprinkle of humor but also a serious undertone. Even items we think of as almost non-perishable have a shelf life. By giving every food item its designated, climate-controlled space, we’re actually prolonging their life. But this is not just about avoiding waste; it’s also about energy efficiency. A well-organized fridge cools more efficiently, which can translate into energy savings over time.\nThere’s a symmetry here that reminds me of hormesis in training. It’s about balance—stress the food items too much, and they spoil; provide the right environment, and they last longer, saving you both waste and money. The fridge becomes a microcosm of broader principles of sustainability and waste management. It’s a confined space where you can actually see the consequences of your choices, like a petri dish for your eco-friendly ambitions.\nIn this context, I see the fridge as a small yet potent platform to exercise responsible consumption. It’s more than a kitchen appliance; it’s a miniature ecosystem where your decisions can help—or hurt—the larger world around you.\n\nRead more at: How to Organize Your Fridge: Keeping Your Food Fresher for Longer\nGo one level up : Food MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Consumers Want Healthier Food, Even if it Costs More"},"Notes/Reinforcement-management-in-the-Transtheoretical-model":{"title":"Reinforcement management in the Transtheoretical model","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Reinforcement management §\nContext §\nWhat is it §\nRewarding oneself when you do good behaviors\nLike a dog almost"},"Notes/Relax-and-Win-WW2-Boxers":{"title":"Relax and Win WW2 Boxers","links":["Notes/The-Relaxation-Mode"],"tags":["-on/relax-history-ww2-on/performance--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nLegacy of Speed\nRelax and Win From Legacy of Speed\nMalcom Gladwell\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62ac472f62ce94f7a90f523e\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nWW2 pilots under a lot of stress\nMaking mistakes\nTeaching people how to relax\nApplied to boxers\nRelax and Win\n\nBud’s book from ?\nWorks with boxers and fighter pilots\n\nSee also §\nThe Relaxation Mode"},"Notes/Relaxation-and-Performance":{"title":"Relaxation and Performance","links":[],"tags":["-relaxation-on/performance-mindset--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nLegacy of Speed\nRelax and Win From Legacy of Speed\nMalcom Gladwell\nurl:\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nRelaxation is so important to performance\nInstead of no pain no gain\nRelax to perform better\nis crazy because it’s completely different\nHe has key phrases\nloose hands loose jaw\nSee also §"},"Notes/Rely-on-Invisible-workouts":{"title":"Rely on Invisible Workouts","links":["Exercises-MOC","Notes/Find-your-reps"],"tags":["-pareto-","-invisible-","-unseen-","-unsexy-"],"content":"There’s the stand up video rant by Red Ollero on how many calories you burn on a treadmill- find the link.\nAnd if you’re trying to do through it through food you’re in trouble.

Due to my undiagnosed condition to nounify everything, I began to refer to these practices as Resiliency Routines. Others who have read Duhigg might refer to them as “Keystone Habits”1. Normal people might just say “things I do in the morning and at night.”\nFor me, in the briefest rendition, it just meant waking up earlier than normal, journaling, and working out. I had one unfair super tool in my arsenal: access to a sauna. So every morning resulted in a sauna-workout.\nIn the sauna one morning I recognized that I was: unhappy, unbalanced, and unproductive.

Traditional tactics like surveys or quick-fix lead magnets miss the soul of this journey. Here’s how to rethink the game:\n\n\nCommunity Over Surveys: The experience of transformation is often collective. Create a hive, not a questionnaire. For instance, think “90-Day Fitness Journey Community,” not “30-question intake survey.”\n\n\nShowcasing Progress: Nothing motivates like evidence. Facilitate a space where members can share milestones and setbacks alike, creating a narrative of authentic transformation.\n\n\nThe Alchemy of Interaction: Want to expedite someone’s transformation? Don’t just dump information; create a vortex of interaction. Ponder on this: How can the community be a catalyst for faster, deeper change?\n\n\nThe Middle Is Where Magic Happens: The middle of the funnel is often seen as a mere transit zone. But this is where the alchemy occurs—through nurturing. The currency isn’t just freebies; it’s the continuous infusion of opportunities to grow, ideally through community interactions and helpful resources.\n\n\nThe missing ingredient in many sales funnels is the sense of caring that turns transactions into transformations. When you build a relationship, you’re not just closing a sale; you’re opening a new chapter in someone’s life journey.\n\nRead more at: How I’m rethinking sales funnels\nGo one level up : Community MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Building a community is a key thing but is so hard"},"Notes/Rethinking-conventional-fitness-wisdom":{"title":"Rethinking conventional fitness wisdom","links":["Notes/Hysteresis-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"Rethinking conventional fitness wisdom §\nConvential wisdom that isn’t true.\nYou have to train hard every day\nYeah if you want to run a marathon.\nBut if you want to\nnot get heart disease\nbe happy\nThe minimum is so low\nHysteresis (concept)"},"Notes/Reversible-decisions-and-irreversible-decisions":{"title":"Reversible decisions and irreversible decisions","links":["Notes/Fear-mongering--Alcohol-kills-brain-cells,-and-the-don't-come-back!","Notes/The-Best-time-to-plant-a-tree-(quote)"],"tags":[],"content":"Reversible decisions and irreversible decisions §\nMost in fitness are reversible\nFear mongering  Alcohol kills brain cells, and the don’t come back!\nThat’s not true.\nIt’s never too late\nStart now\nThe Best time to plant a tree (quote)\nThings are more reversible than you think\nVery few decision in life are actually completely irreversible"},"Notes/Revisiting-your-workouts":{"title":"Revisiting your workouts","links":["Notes/My-Canon-of-Books","Notes/Beginner's-Mind","Notes/The-key-kasi-is-reflection"],"tags":[],"content":"Revisiting your workouts §\nAnalogy §\n\n\nI reread LOTR\n\n\nI reread Dante\n\n\nI rewatch LOTR\n\n\nIt’s a different experience each time\n\n\nThese are things where I like the journey not the destination\n\n\nFor example, I would walk the camino again.\n\n\nBecause it’s not an experience to consume, but one to journey through\n\n\nKey Idea §\n\nAre there workouts or programs where you enjoy the journey?\nDon’t think of workouts as one and dones\nCan you revisit it in a fun way?\n\nSee also §\n\nMy Canon of Books\nBeginner’s Mind\nThe key kasi is reflection\n"},"Notes/Reviving-the-Essence-of-Play-for-All-Ages":{"title":"Reviving the Essence of Play for All Ages","links":["Maps/Movement-MOC","Notes/Free-play-and-structured-play-in-children"],"tags":["play","mental-health","society","wellbeing","aging"],"content":"In the modern world, the concept of play has been restricted to children, often framed as a phase of life that ends once adult responsibilities kick in. This truncated perspective overlooks the profound psychological and physiological benefits of play that extend throughout one’s lifetime.\nPlay is not a childish endeavor but an essential facet of human nature that nurtures creativity, problem-solving abilities, and emotional resilience.\nThe societal drift towards productivity and “useful” activities has not only stripped children of unstructured playtime but also deprived adults of the joy and stress-relief that come from playful activities. This can contribute to rising rates of mental health issues across all age groups.\nWe should be asking ourselves why we took play away from children and made it about productivity, rather than extending the liberty to play to all age groups.

Usually say what you want as a fan of capitalism about the efficiency of these modern conditions of production. That’s undeniable. But there was always a trade off and one of the trade offs here from Marks and de boer is going to be that the consumer is fundamentally alienated from the creative process of everything that they buy that performs an important function in their\nlife, because we no longer have to actually make the stuff that we use every day. We don’t ever have to consider all the other people.\nYou can’t just choose to abstain from the economic system. Like someone can just walk out of a catholic mass. If they think it’s all nonsense, you have to be a part of it in some way. And as you do that, there are literally teams of people out there working in close correlation with algorithms. Super smart people where their entire job is to look at your tendencies on these screens and find any way they can to get you to spend more time contemplating the spectacle instead of living, there is so much more to talk about here\nYou see the same thing emerged at the heads of companies in the private sector, you have these enormously powerful people that are the faces of giant businesses and you’re sold. What feels like a marketing campaign about how brilliant these people are. Like they’re playing 4D chess at a level no one can fully understand because they’re just not as smart as them. But then you do some digging into the other side of the story and it’s like, are these people really unparalleled intellects of our time that are gonna save the world or is this a marketing campaign? I’m being sold to instill confidence in shareholders because the markets based on mass psychology. Again, the funny thing to Tabor is that even if it is just a marketing campaign for a lot of people out there. It doesn’t even really bother them that much.\nThat’s interesting because the goal of society is to separate you from the means of everything. I was really struck by phrase and idea of being separated to the means of consumption. Like the goal of capitalism is not separate you from what you make but also from what you consume.\nYou have no idea where anything comes from. And you are worse of (or better depending on your perspective) either way, your stuff just works like a magical object.\nThat reminds me The fragility of food systems and The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\nIt’s similar because food systems are the same. No one knows where food comes from. It’s just like magic. When you start to think about where your food actually comes from you have no idea. And I like to know. Because I want to be responsible. I want to take responsibilty for what I eat, earn and do.\nIt’s different because For some people this is a good thing. Being able to not think about where you are getting things from.\nIt’s important because it’s important to know. If you want to be a responsible person, you should do this.\n\nRead more at: Episode | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nSnippets:\nAirrQuote | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nAirrQuote | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nAirrQuote | Episode #171 … Guy Debord - The Society of the Spectacle\nGo one level up : Philosophy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Capitalism and it destroys the health of workers"},"Notes/SolarPunk":{"title":"SolarPunk","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Our Changing Climate video on Nebula"},"Notes/Solutions-to-Flow-Stoppers":{"title":"Solutions to Flow Stoppers","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/flow","Notes/Enthusiasm-(re-Flow)","Notes/Attention-(re-Flow)","Notes/Direction-(re-Flow)","Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)"],"tags":["flow"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#flow\nSolutions to Flow Stoppers §\n\n Organize these using the four factors\n\n\nReduce Distractions — This is the number one killer of flow. (Main Element: Attention)\nDo activities you naturally want to do — Obviously this can get you in trouble if these activities take you away from your responsibilities to your family, finances, friends, and to society as a whole. So with that disclaimer out of the way, if you do the things that easily get you into flow—and ideally create some sort of additional value (extra money, quality time with others)—then it’s likely not a destructive type of flow (like playing online games too much). (Main Element: Enthusiasm (re Flow))\nReduce the amount of competing things you want to do — Too many projects, desires, and wants can make them all slip through your fingers, or as said in the Count of Monte Cristo, “evaporate into a thousand follies.” (Main Elements: Attention (re Flow), Direction (re Flow))\n\nNarrow your attention — In the moment, take a mental step back and try to narrow your attention on the task at hand. If you’re at a computer screen, this means closing tabs and applications and eliminating things that are robbing your attention.\n\n\nTake a deep breath, take a walk, change your environment — Whether it’s burnout, lowered energy from sitting too much, or just feeling overwhelm; knowing when (and how) to change things up is a crucial skill for many things—including for recentering so you can once again find flow. (Main Element: Energy (re Flow), Attention (re Flow))\nTie your present activity to your goals in some way — More often than not, we find ourselves doing something we wish we weren’t doing. Try to find a way to relate the activity to your goals in some way. (Main Elements: Direction (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow))\n\nMake a game out of it — So you really don’t see any strong connection between your activity and your goals, so you just can’t seem to summon the enthusiasm for it. So try making a game out of it. How fast can you get the task done with complete focus and zero distractions? If it’s an event with people, maybe try to get into a few higher, quality, deeper conversations; or maybe just make a game out of asking really good questions. (Main Elements: Direction (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow))\n\n\nSleep well. Eat Well. Hydrate well — If your energy is low because you’ve somehow neglected taking care of yourself, then it will be much harder to induce flow because low energy means decreased mood and increased distractibility.

They developed mind palaces and other mnemonic devices. Central to their efforts of recalling things was placing bits of information into a spatial context.\nIt turns out we remember things really well if we can place them spatially in our minds. It’s an extremely strong form of memory. A term for using a spatial context for memory is called the Method of Loci.\nSee the main maps I included in the Home note? Depending on your desires, you could always give them a basic numbering system—like 010 Mindsets and 020 Concepts to create a form of spatial context in the File Explorer in the sidebar."},"Notes/Specificity-in-Goal-Setting--A-Catalyst-for-Tangible-Success":{"title":"Specificity in Goal-Setting: A Catalyst for Tangible Success","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","Notes/Kye-He-The-Case-Against-Goals"],"tags":["goal-setting","metrics","entrepreneurship","personal-development"],"content":"The journey to any worthwhile achievement begins with a question: What do you want to accomplish? While this might sound painfully obvious, the devil is truly in the details. The article “You 2.0” urges us to be specific in our aspirations. But why does specificity matter so much? Here’s the deal: vague goals are the dream-killers. They’re the desert mirages that keep you chasing an illusion.\nJust saying “I want to be successful” or “I want to grow my coaching business” lacks the precision necessary for actionable steps. It’s like telling your GPS, “Take me somewhere fun!” Sure, you might end up somewhere interesting, but is it the destination you truly desired? Highly unlikely.\nIn my experience, clarity acts like a compass. When I pin down specifics—such as “I aim to add $70K to my freelance revenue” or “I’m shooting for 10K subscribers for my newsletter”—the fog lifts. The nebulous transforms into the tangible. My brain then flips into problem-solving mode, finding avenues I hadn’t even considered before. This is because specificity acts as a sort of language that your brain understands—much like how it efficiently uses shortcuts to resist change.\nConversely, ever wondered why your body and mind resist vague changes? It’s the same reason; the lack of clarity creates a maze without an exit. Your brain doesn’t know which “shortcut” to take. In entrepreneurial terms, think of specificity as your business plan. Without it, you’re sailing without a map, susceptible to the storms of doubt and the whirlpools of indecision.\nSo, if you want to venture beyond the land of wishful thinking into the realm of tangible accomplishments, get specific. And not just “newsletter-launching” specific, but “first-10K-subscribers” specific. It’s that granular detail that turns what could be just another introspective thought into an actionable strategy.\n\nRead more at: What do you want to accomplish in your life? 7 sample answers\nGo one level up : Entrepreneurship MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Kye He The Case Against Goals"},"Notes/Speed,-Explosiveness-is-very-High-level-movement":{"title":"Speed, Explosiveness is very High level movement","links":["Notes/Dan-John's-Intervention","Dan-John","Notes/Assume-You're-below-average"],"tags":[],"content":"The final progression is speed (very few people need to be here) §\nSource: §\n\nDan John’s Intervention\nby Dan John\n\nHighlights (Key Ideas) §\n\nDan John has this quote: “Don’t add speed on top of dysfunction”\n\nIt’s a recipe for pain and injury\n\n\nAnother way of looking at this, is that everyone wants to do the speed progression\n\nThat’s the fun part that looks cool\nBut very few of us will actually perform here.\nThis is world class level\n\n\n\nSee also §\n\nAssume You’re below average\n"},"Notes/Spirituality-I-feel-everything":{"title":"Spirituality I feel everything","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I feel everything at the same time"},"Notes/Split-Leg-Work-in-Training":{"title":"Split Leg Work in Training","links":["Notes/202112181554--Neuromotor-Training","Notes/Alignment-of-values-in-training"],"tags":["-on/training-strategy-body--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThe Peter Attia Drive\nThe Art of Stability | Beth Lewis\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62de4ee19280c589ea2a7d0c\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nIf you’re looking for the most bang for your buck when it comes to training, split work training is the way to go.

For example, someone may not be interested in developing a habit of regular exercise, but they may be motivated by the desire to fit back into a specific dress that they haven’t been able to wear in a while.\nThis concept also suggests that coaches should avoid identifying themselves as “habits coaches” or other specific labels, as people are not typically searching for a coach in that specific area. Instead, coaches should focus on meeting clients where they are currently at and understanding their specific goals and motivations. This will allow the coach to better tailor their approach and connect with the client on a deeper level.\nAdditionally, the idea is also pointing out that coaches often make the mistake of diving too deep into the coaching process too soon before earning the right to do so. It’s important for coaches to understand that building trust and rapport with the clients is essential to be able to take them where they want to go, and the process of earning trust takes time.\nIn summary, the idea is that people are motivated by the results of good habits, not the habits themselves. Coaches should focus on understanding the clients’ goals and meeting them where they are currently at, rather than identifying themselves as a specific type of coach. Building trust and rapport is essential to be able to take the clients where they want to go.\nThat’s interesting because\nThat reminds me\nIt’s similar because\nIt’s different because\nIt’s important because"},"Notes/Stop-bracing-and-move-subconsciously":{"title":"Stop bracing and move subconsciously","links":["Notes/Train-for-things-to-be-pretty","Notes/Good-movement-usually-looks-pretty-(concept)"],"tags":["-movement-subconscious-trust-on/body-awareness--"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nThe Peter Attia Drive\nThe Art of Stability | Beth Lewis\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/62de49ce9280c589ea29e098\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nSo how do you learn to not brace all the time?

When you’re able to do that, you’ll find that you’re able to move through life with more ease and grace.

Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then –and this is the “weakly held” part– prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result. - Paul Saffo, circa 2008\n\nWeak opinions are problematic because people aren’t inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the energy required to test them.\nEqually, don’t be too attached to what you believe, otherwise, it undermines your ability to “see” and “hear” evidence that clashes with your opinions. This is what psychologists sometimes call the problem of ”Confirmation Bias.&quot;&quot; (not included in the LYT Kit)\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2020-05-28\ncreated:: 2020-05-28\n\n\n"},"Notes/Structural-Interference-and-Capacity-Interference":{"title":"Structural Interference and Capacity Interference","links":["Motor-Control-and-Learning:-A-Behavioral-Emphasis","Gabriele-Wulf"],"tags":[],"content":"Structural Interference and Capacity Interference §\nContext §\nThis was something from before pa.\nLike the things that make it hard to exercise\nWhat are the concepts §\nStructural interference\n\nthings like things in your way.

The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms, the phrase is best understood as “Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.”\nHerbert Spencer first used the phrase, after reading Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, in his Principles of Biology (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin’s biological ones: “This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called ‘natural selection’, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.”Darwin responded positively to Alfred Russel Wallace’s suggestion of using Spencer’s new phrase “survival of the fittest” as an alternative to “natural selection”, and adopted the phrase in The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication published in 1868. In On the Origin of Species, he introduced the phrase in the fifth edition published in 1869, intending it to mean “better designed for an immediate, local environment”.\nWikipedia\n\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2017\ncreated:: 2017\ncoined:: 1864\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Swamp-Cooler":{"title":"Swamp Cooler","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"What is a Swamp Cooler §\nIt seems like a way to cool things"},"Notes/Synthesis":{"title":"Synthesis","links":["Maps/Concepts-MOC","tags/concept","Convergence","201408190641","Notes/MOCs-are-Dialectics"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"up:: Concepts MOC\ntags::#concept\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nSome content and links have been removed.\n\n\nSynthesis §\nThe combining of separate elements or substances to form a coherent whole.\nRelated: Convergence\nExample Usage, Keywords, Concepts, and Metaphors §\n\nThesis.

It’s like a shadow that follows us into adulthood, affecting our decisions, actions, and even our self-worth. Research shows a direct correlation between parental expectations and a child’s fear of failure. The more parents react negatively to perceived failures, the more the child internalizes this fear, sometimes to the point of developing atychiphobia—an irrational and paralyzing fear of failure.\nSpeaking from personal experience, I can attest to the weight of this fear. As someone who has always strived to excel in athletics, the fear of not meeting my own high standards has become a constant companion. It’s like running a race with a backpack full of bricks; it slows you down and exhausts you, but you can’t seem to take it off.\nThis brings to mind the concept of hormesis in exercise and stress management. Just as a certain amount of stress can be beneficial for growth, perhaps what’s needed is a balanced approach to failure. The key is to reframe it not as a dead-end but as a detour on the road to success.\nSo, how do we confront this fear? One actionable experiment could be to deliberately put ourselves in situations where failure is a possibility but the stakes are low. For example, giving a talk at a local meetup, producing a single podcast episode, or writing an article and sharing it with a few friends. The idea is to expose ourselves to the fear in a controlled setting, thereby desensitizing ourselves to it over time.\nIn summary, the fear of failure is not just an individual problem but a systemic one, often rooted in early life experiences and societal expectations.

If it worked for Kassie in adopting a vegetarian lifestyle, who’s to say it can’t be a part of our arsenal in making lasting changes?\nIn the health and fitness coaching landscape where I navigate, the instinct is often to tailor everything to the individual, to make it “unique.” But let’s be honest: reinventing the wheel every time isn’t just tedious—it’s often unnecessary. The balance between customization and efficiency is like that of an athlete knowing when to push and when to rest. The “copy and paste” strategy offers a useful blueprint to springboard off of.\nThis approach fits snugly with the principle of “standing on the shoulders of giants.” Why slog through the swamp of trial and error when there are proven paths you can follow? As in, if a vegetarian lifestyle is achieved successfully with particular meal strategies, one can replicate that method without a second thought.\nI believe that we could weave this strategy into the coaching practice seamlessly. There’s a sort of elegance in finding what works, cloning it, and then tweaking it to fit one’s needs. After all, isn’t that what successful businesses, great athletes, and even ecosystems do? They adapt based on existing successful models. It’s a lesson in humility, acknowledging that others might have cracked a code you’re trying to decipher.\nSo, my respect for the “copy and paste” strategy grows. It’s not about abandoning innovation but recognizing that innovation often comes from iteration, not ideation. Why not give our clients—and ourselves—the best possible starting point?\n\nRead more at: To Kickstart a New Behavior, Copy and Paste - By Katy Milkman - Behavioral Scientist\nGo one level up : Habits MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Habit Stacking by James Clear"},"Notes/The-Art-of-Being--Why-Comparison-is-the-Thief-of-Joy":{"title":"The Art of Being: Why Comparison is the Thief of Joy","links":["Poetry-MOC","Notes/Don't-Let-Imposter-Syndrome-Stop-you"],"tags":["self-compassion","comparison","voice","relative","relationships"],"content":"The Trap of Comparison\nPaudre Gautuma’s words resonate deeply with me. In a world that often feels like a constant competition, it’s easy to fall into the trap of comparison. Whether it’s in the realm of poetry, health coaching, or any other field, comparing oneself to others can be a creativity killer. It’s like a mental treadmill—you’re running but going nowhere.\nThe Value of Learning\nThat’s not to say we should exist in a vacuum. Learning from others is crucial. It’s how we grow and evolve in our respective fields. But there’s a fine line between learning and comparing. The former empowers us; the latter disempowers us. It’s the difference between seeing someone’s work and thinking, “What can I learn from this?” versus “Why can’t I be like this?”\nLate Bloomers and the Illusion of Time\nFeeling like you’ve come late to something shouldn’t diminish your passion or your potential contributions. In fact, sometimes coming in “late” can offer a fresh perspective, unburdened by the jadedness that can come with years in a field. It’s never too late to make a meaningful impact.\nWhy This Matters to Me\nAs someone who’s building a coaching practice and striving to be a thought leader, I find this a timely reminder. Comparison can be a significant roadblock, but it’s one that can be overcome by focusing on my unique voice and contributions. It’s not about being the first or the best; it’s about being authentically me.\n\nRead more at: Vidyan Ravinthiran — Artist | The On Being Project\nGo one level up : Poetry MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Don’t Let Imposter Syndrome Stop you"},"Notes/The-Art-of-Body-Balance-in-a-World-of-Overwhelm":{"title":"The Art of Body Balance in a World of Overwhelm","links":["Maps/Physical-Training-MOC","Notes/Don't-push-yourself,-pull-yourself"],"tags":["body-balance","self-assessment","holistic-health","practical-fitness"],"content":"We often think of balancing our bodies as a Herculean task requiring monumental effort. In the overwhelming maze of health tips, tests, and benchmarks, one can easily lose sight of the forest for the trees. The wisdom from “An Owner’s Manual for Your Body” serves as a refreshing guide to navigate this maze. It drives home the point that balancing your body doesn’t have to be an exhausting struggle. In fact, it can be integrated into the nooks and crannies of our everyday lives.\nFor instance, the book discusses 10 tests and 10 corresponding practices to assess and improve vital signs. The beauty lies in the simplicity and accessibility of these practices. Like little islands of mindfulness, they can be scattered throughout your day. No Herculean efforts, no massive time commitments. Just small changes that cumulatively create a sea change.\nBut here’s where it gets tricky. You might be thinking, “With all these resources, why isn’t everyone a paradigm of health?” Well, the problem is not a lack of information but rather a lack of true knowledge. In a world teeming with fitness “noise,” discerning the melody that harmonizes with your body is the real challenge. Trust me, I get it. When you’re delving deep into health and coaching, you realize that balance isn’t a one-size-fits-all blueprint but a personalized work of art.\nThink of it as cooking a complex dish; you’ve got numerous ingredients, each contributing its own flavor. Too much of one and the dish is ruined, too little of another and it’s bland. The same goes for body balance, which is an amalgamation of nutrition, sleep, exercise, breathing, and even mental well-being. You’re the chef, and you’ve got to find the unique recipe that brings out the best in you.\nBombus, a company mentioned in the article, with its charitable mission tied into everyday products like socks and t-shirts, is a fascinating example of integrating something meaningful into the mundane. Imagine if we did that with our health—sprinkling pockets of meaningful, health-boosting activities throughout our daily routines.\nUnderstanding the “micro” can indeed help us master the “macro.” In a world that seems to constantly demand more from us, perhaps it’s time we demand more from it—in small, sustainable bites. After all, it’s often the subtle strokes that complete the masterpiece.\n\nRead more at: #611.

Each of these can be broken down into ‘micro-courses,’ bite-sized lessons that are easily digestible and immediately actionable.\nThe Advantages of Micro-Education in Health Coaching\nAccessibility: Micro-education makes learning flexible and convenient, aligning well with busy lifestyles.\nFocus: It allows you to zero in on a specific issue—whether it&#039;s dietary choices or mental wellbeing.\nEfficacy: With micro-education, you can get to the point fast, offer value quickly, and, as a result, potentially see quicker client transformations.\n\nTherefore, as a health coach, shifting the narrative towards education could be the Trojan Horse that infiltrates the guarded city of the ‘boring workout’ syndrome.

The reality is that we’re all flawed beings, each with our own set of quirks, insecurities, and emotional complexities.\nIn my own coaching practice and life, I often emphasize the courage it takes to love someone who is as flawed as you are. The beauty of love lies not in perfection but in the willingness to grow together, to poke and prod at each other’s vulnerabilities, and to emerge stronger for it. It’s about finding someone who’s scarred and bruised, just like you, and offering to help each other heal and grow.\nThis is the good stuff—the marrow of meaningful relationships.

But here’s the kicker: often, these proclamations stem from their own insecurities. They’re shouting to drown out their own doubts.\nIn my own journey, I’ve realized that the most sustainable path is to be authentically yourself.

But what if, instead of making people hunt for healthier options, we make nutritious, delicious, and affordable food the default? Here’s the kicker: healthy meals don’t need a prescription, they need a platform— an economic and social one.\nUnpacking the Economic Nuances\nWhile individual effort can’t be discounted, the collective endeavor carries far more weight. Why? Because not everyone has the time or resources to sift through myriad food choices. We often say ‘food is medicine,’ but we don’t make it as readily available as a fast-food burger. It’s almost like we’ve designed a game that’s rigged against the player.\nI often find myself entangled in the “food as medicine” narrative in my coaching practice. But it’s not about creating a medicalized food culture; it’s about making the healthy choice the easy choice. That way, I don’t have to convince my clients to seek out quinoa when it’s right there next to the fries. It should be a national effort to tip the scales in favor of good health.\nZooming Out: It’s More Than Just Food\nWe’re not going to overhaul the entire food system overnight, but even a small shift can create a butterfly effect. Making nutritious food the default not only addresses public health but also feeds into a more sustainable, ethical food system.

From sleep scores to workout metrics, we’re inundated with numbers that promise to quantify our well-being. But what if these numbers are not just reflective but also directive, influencing how we actually feel?\nConsider the “nocebo” effect, the evil twin of the placebo effect. While a placebo can make you feel better through positive expectations, a nocebo can make you feel worse through negative ones. If you wake up to a sub-par sleep score, your day might already feel ruined, regardless of how you actually slept. It’s a compelling example of how psychology can override physiology.\nThis is a cautionary tale for those of us in the health and fitness industry. While metrics can be incredibly useful, they can also be misleading or even harmful. It’s like hiking with a GPS that sometimes leads you off the trail. Sure, it’s mostly reliable, but when it’s not, you could end up lost or, worse, in danger.\nSo, the next time you’re tempted to obsess over a score or metric, remember that your perception of that number can be as impactful as the number itself. It’s not just about the data; it’s about how the data makes you feel. And sometimes, the healthiest choice might be to ignore the numbers and listen to your body instead.\nThis resonates with me because I’ve seen how the psychology of metrics can impact not just performance but also self-perception. A good score can boost your confidence, but a bad one can do the opposite, even if it’s not an accurate reflection of your well-being.\n\nRead more at: The Case Against Optimizing - by Brady Holmer\nGo one level up : Body MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Overoptimizing Burning out and working out"},"Notes/The-Duality-of-Information-Overload-in-the-Age-of-Abundance":{"title":"The Duality of Information Overload in the Age of Abundance","links":["Maps/Thinking-MOC","Notes/The-Economics-of-Abundance--How-Technology-Defies-Scarcity"],"tags":["information-overload","information","choice","analysis-paralysis","self-education","learning","digital-lifestyle"],"content":"We’re at an interesting crossroads in the age of information. On the one hand, the “Paradox of Abundance” looms large: a phenomenon where the sheer volume of available information turns from a benefit into a burden. While we have the privilege of accessing lectures from the brightest minds ever to exist—literally at our fingertips—we also have to sift through an endless barrage of trivial content that adds little value to our lives. How bizarre is it that one can seamlessly switch from watching a life-changing TED Talk to zoning out with mindless internet fights?\nIt’s tempting to view this ocean of data as purely a treasure trove of wisdom waiting to be unearthed. But let’s not kid ourselves. The paradox lies in the fact that this abundance often leads to information overload. We get so bombarded with data that it becomes a task in itself to find what’s genuinely valuable. This overload often leads to a state of decision paralysis, freezing us in our tracks instead of motivating us to grow. It’s akin to standing at the edge of an infinite library but not knowing which book to pick up.\nNow, you might ask, “How do we navigate this labyrinth of information without getting lost?” It’s not about being a passive consumer; it’s about becoming a discerning participant in this digital ecosystem. We need to be agile curators of our own content diets, cherry-picking what truly enriches us and consciously avoiding the mind-numbing noise.\nThis resonates with my own experiences because, as someone knee-deep in the world of coaching and self-improvement, I see how easy it is for people to drown in resources without making any real progress. Imagine a symphony of influences, all playing at the same time. The art lies in conducting this symphony so that it plays your life’s theme song, not a cacophony of random notes. And yes, let’s not forget, even in a symphony, some silence is golden. Sometimes, unplugging is the best way to plug into what really matters.\nRecognizing and addressing the “Paradox of Abundance” in this digital age is more than just an intellectual exercise. It’s a necessity for mental clarity, focused growth, and ultimately, a fulfilling life.\n\nRead more at: The Paradox of Abundance - David Perell\nGo one level up : Thinking MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Economics of Abundance- How Technology Defies Scarcity"},"Notes/The-Economics-of-Abundance--How-Technology-Defies-Scarcity":{"title":"The Economics of Abundance- How Technology Defies Scarcity","links":["Maps/Social-Sciences-MOC","Notes/A-vision-of-the-creator-economy-that-works"],"tags":["technology","scarcity","resources","innovation","economics","work"],"content":"The statement that “nitrogen doesn’t cost anything” might raise eyebrows, especially for those of us who understand that even air isn’t “free” in a polluted city. What the author likely means is that when a resource is abundant and easily accessible, its cost tends to be negligible. However, this overlooks the costs associated with extraction, refinement, and distribution.\nThe crux of the matter is the transformative power of technology to shift the economics of scarcity. Think about it: centuries ago, salt was a precious commodity. Now, it’s so cheap and abundant that we scatter it on icy roads. The same could be said for information in the digital age. Once confined to libraries and scholars, it’s now virtually free and at our fingertips.\nIn the realm of health and fitness, this principle is a game-changer. Advanced technologies could make personalized medicine or tailored fitness programs more accessible, reducing the “cost” of optimal health. Imagine a future where AI-driven health coaching is as ubiquitous and affordable as a Google search.\nBut there’s a flip side. As technology makes resources abundant, it also has the potential to make some skills and jobs obsolete. It’s a double-edged sword that requires thoughtful navigation.\nSo, while the concept of “infinite intelligence” solving most problems is enticing, it’s not a magic wand. It’s a tool that, when wielded wisely, can create abundance out of scarcity, but also demands a new kind of literacy to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape\n\nRead more at: Infinite Intelligence - by Tomas Pueyo\nGo one level up : Social Sciences MOC\nYou may also be interested in: A vision of the creator economy that works"},"Notes/The-Effects-of-Social-Isolation-in-Sport":{"title":"The Effects of Social Isolation in Sport","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://thesportjournal.org/article/covid-19-social-isolation-and-optimism-in-sport/"},"Notes/The-Emotional-Landscape-of-Feeding-Kids--It-Takes-a-Village":{"title":"The Emotional Landscape of Feeding Kids: It Takes a Village","links":["Maps/Parenting-MOC","Notes/Our-grandparents-had-to-actually-produce-food"],"tags":["parenting","challenges","nutritional","education","emotional-health","team"],"content":"Feeding children is not just a logistical challenge; it’s an emotional journey that can feel like a rollercoaster. One moment you’re on a high because your child took a bite of broccoli, and the next, you’re plummeting because they’ve decided that crackers are the only food group that matters.\nAs a parent, it’s easy to internalize these ups and downs as personal successes or failures. However, it’s crucial to remember that you’re not in this alone. The task of instilling good eating habits in a child is a collective endeavor, much like building a house. You may lay the foundation, but you need architects, builders, and interior designers—in the form of partners, family, and the broader environment—to complete the structure.\nModeling good habits is like being the site manager on this construction project. You set the tone and direction, but you also collaborate with others to ensure the project’s success. The podcast episode serves as a reminder that experts in the field, like Dr. Becky Kennedy and Megan McNamee, can act as valuable consultants, offering strategies and insights that can make the process less stressful and more effective.\nSo, the next time you find yourself on that emotional rollercoaster, remember: it’s not just your ride.

With years of experience and expertise, I’ve built a solid foundation. However, transparency is the missing puzzle piece in my thought leadership journey. It’s akin to having a well-stocked library but keeping it locked away from the public. What good is knowledge if it’s not shared openly?\nThe concept of “escape velocity” is intriguing. It’s the point where you’ve gained enough momentum in two distinct streams that you can create something entirely new. Think of Scott Adams, who blended business acumen with cartooning to create a unique voice. It’s like hiking two different trails and discovering a hidden path that connects them, offering a new perspective that only you can provide.\nFor me, the challenge lies in being more transparent about my learnings and experiences. Transparency isn’t just about openness; it’s about vulnerability. It’s about sharing not just the polished final product but also the messy, complicated process that led to it. This is where I need to focus my efforts.\nThis matters to me because I realize that authority without transparency is like a locked treasure chest. The value is there, but it’s not fully accessible.

It’s not the physical borders that we cross but the internal boundaries—constrained by societal norms, familial expectations, and self-imposed limitations—that truly expand. The article “On Travel, Living Abroad &amp; Losing Your Self” paints an intriguing notion about third culture adults. What struck me is that these individuals have “disconnected from their own default paths” and exist in a state of “lack of legibility.”\nI’m nodding my head vigorously as I read this. I’ve always felt that I’m a bit of a cultural hybrid, zigzagging between worlds and not fully belonging to any. There’s freedom in such an existence. Third culture adults are like will-o’-the-wisps, illuminating paths not typically seen, existing in the murky territories between societal containers. No, we aren’t this or that, but an amalgamation of experiences, thoughts, and contradictions.\nRemember those puzzling questions like, “What’s bad about changing?” and “What’s good about not changing?” from earlier musings? They fit like a glove here. Third culture living is a conscious choice to step away from dichotomous thinking. We don’t neatly fit into societal “somebody containers,” and why should we? Those containers limit perspective, confine growth, and let’s be honest, they are boring! We’d rather be a multitude, a labyrinth of experiences and thoughts.\nThe beauty is in giving others the space to be confusing, to be a myriad of things without needing to “understand” them in the traditional sense. That’s like choosing to enjoy a complex piece of art without needing to dissect every brush stroke. You appreciate it for what it is—a confluence of contradictions, a palette of emotions, and an ever-changing spectacle.\nAnd there’s a certain resonance with the idea of hormesis here: a bit of stress, a bit of dissonance, a bit of contradiction—all these make us more resilient and open-minded. I find it exhilarating to be part of a community that not only accepts but celebrates these facets.

There are a few things to keep in mind when you’re choosing foods for recovery.\nFirst, you want to make sure you’re getting enough protein to help repair and rebuild muscle tissue. Second, you want to focus on anti-inflammatory foods to help reduce swelling and pain. And lastly, you want to make sure you’re getting plenty of vitamins and minerals to support the overall healing process.\n\nProtein\n\nProtein is essential for repairing and rebuilding muscle tissue. If you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough protein in your diet.\nThere are all sorts of ways to get protein in your diet. You can get it from meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs, and plants. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, you can get protein from tofu, tempeh, beans, lentils, and nuts.\n\nVitamin C\n\nVitamin C is important for collagen production. Collagen is a protein that helps to repair and rebuild tissue. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough vitamin C in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in vitamin C. Some of the best include citrus fruits, bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale.\n\nVitamin A\n\nVitamin A is important for cell growth and repair. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough vitamin A in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in vitamin A. Some of the best include sweet potatoes, carrots, dark leafy greens, and squash.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are important for inflammation. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough omega-3 fatty acids in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Some of the best include salmon, tuna, sardines, flaxseeds, and chia seeds.\n\nAntioxidants\n\nAntioxidants are important for reducing inflammation. So if you’re trying to recover from an injury, you want to make sure you’re getting enough antioxidants in your diet.\nThere are plenty of foods that are high in antioxidants. Some of the best include berries, dark chocolate, green tea, and turmeric.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when you’re choosing foods for recovery.

When we worked on assembly lines and in big corporate offices, projects made sense because order and linearity reigned. But today, more and more of us are working with ideas, and ideas need room to grow, evolve, and have a chance to fully form into whatever they might be becoming.\n\nEfforts are freeing.\n\nEfforts don’t need a deadline §\nProjects require deadlines. But efforts are flexible, fluid, and adaptable. They can have no deadlines, hard deadlines, soft deadlines—and likely various deadlines for various versions of the same idea outputted to different mediums in different final forms.\n\nEfforts are fluid.\n\nEfforts don’t have a clear size §\nThey can be bigger than projects, or smaller, and oftentimes their size is hard to know.

I was writing, posting on Twitter, building in public and trying to see what people were resonating with. But something still wasn’t clicking and I wasn’t sure what it was.\nThen I started working with Shruthi\nToday, I am clear about my niche and who I want to serve.

I truly want to help people stuck in injury to enjoy their lives again.\nWhat was the one thing that helped you get insane clarity and propel your business forward?\nWorking with Shruthi is both fun and challenging. She is supportive and at the same time clear on what steps I need to take for growth.\nI got the most value when we did an exercise on thinking about my ideal customer. I’m done many customer avatar exercises before, but I was still afraid to narrow it down.\n“What if it’s too narrow?”\n“What if I’m limiting myself?”\n“What if there are people outside of my niche I want to help?”\nAll those questions were strong in my mind.\nShruthi helped me accept that it’s not just about me, it’s also about who I want to help. Who are the VERY specific people that I have the skills to help? Can I focus all my energy on finding and helping those people = aka my niche\nHow clear are your next steps of action after the coaching?\nNow that I know I’m focusing on people who need mental fitness to trust their body, I’m more propelled to write, research, and reach out.\nBack then, when I called myself a health coach, it was hard to find who I was talking to. Because everyone needs a health coach in some way. As I said, I couldn’t set myself apart.\nNow, when I see someone I can help, I want to go out of my way to offer them resources and support.\nIt’s simple, but it’s not easy- and this is the stage I’m practicing now.
