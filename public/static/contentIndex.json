But getting there isn’t so simple.\nMaxim 1 is reminds us: “The goals don’t come from the coach, they come from the client.” As a coach, my goal is to listen to you, understand what your goal is, and then offer my experience to help you do what you already want to do.\nHighlight the desire that they already have.\nMaxim 2: Help them feel successful §\nThe trick to long term change is to string together small successes.\nYou might feel like this is cheating- and that you shouldn’t celebrate until you hit you big goal at the end. But the opposite is true. Our brain loves feeling like it’s winning. And by giving it small wins, it’s willing to do more of that. Make your clients feel like they’re already succeeding- in small ways.

They affect each other.\nPick the one you’d like to work on and leverage that to build the other two.\n—\n#1 Practice good sleep habits\nFor some stupid reason, I still hear people brag about how little sleep they get away with. STOP\nSleep is THE NUMBER ONE thing you can do for your health. It can:\n\nReduce stress\nMore energy\nBetter focus\nThis list could just goes on\n\n—\nWhen you get good sleep, you’ll have more energy to move. If your sleep habits are consistent, the body can regulate your appetite better.\nYour health flywheel starts spinning\n—\n#2 Nutrition: Let the good food crowd out the junk\nThe number 1 reason diets fail is by trying to be too good too fast.\nThat’s like trying to stop a train moving at full speed.\nInstead, don’t cut out the junk yet. Start by introducing good food instead.\n\nAdd veggies\nGo for less processed food\nTry leaner meats\n\nTrust that over time, you’ll appreciate good foods too- then you can try and cut back on the junk.\n—\nAs you eat well, you’ll start to fuel your body properly. Movement will be easier with that fuel. And cutting back the junk helps you sleep better.\nYour health flywheel starts spinning\n—\n#3 Movement: Stop ‘exercising’- keep moving instead\nModern life has squished all our movement into 1 hour of exercise\n\nGym sessions\nMovement classes\nCardio time\n\nThis forgets that our bodies are designed to be constantly on the move.\n—\nReframe: How can you ‘exercise’ less, but move all day instead?\n\nTake a walk and catch up with a friend?\nBike to and from work?\nHave more physical hobbies- like woodworking or gardening?\n\n—\nAs you start to move more, your body will be tired and ready sleep each night. You’ll also start looking for the food you need to refuel yourself well.\nYour health flywheel starts spinning\n—\nTLDR: How to get your health flywheel spinning\n\nDevelop a steady sleep routine\nLet good foods crowd out junk\nStop exercising and start moving\n\nOnce your health flywheel, you’ll discover there are tricks within each one.

Sleep is the miracle drug that no one really takes. There are so many benefits to getting good sleep. But we still treat sleep deprivation like it’s some kind of superpower.\nIn reality, being able to sleep well and accept sleep is better.\n—\nFind ways to move, and not just exercise.\nA culture of exercising takes away from the fact that we just need to be moving all the time.

And those early ones count the most!\nGive yourself a low minimum, the rest is gravy §\nBecause those early steps count the most- the benefit is biggest at the start. Get those early steps in by setting a generously low minimum for yourself. Make it easy to get out the door.\nThe trap of 10,000 steps is that we believe the benefits are at the end.

And as much as I would love to have time to go on long runs or hit up the gym, I just can’t. So I’m practicing establishing a minimum workout. And then not feeling so guilty when I have to resort to that.\n2. Sneak in more activity §\nAnother trick I like is finding ways to get a little bit more physical activity throughout the day. Standing desk is the classic example of this. My personal fave is using a basket instead of a cart when grocery shopping. (I gotta carry it around + I end up buying less).\n3. Stop Comparing Myself to Myself §\nMaybe the hardest one for me, but I find I’m always thinking back to how fit I used to be back then.

Almost always something was a bit off- and I would find different ways to fix it.\nI didn’t have to wonder if I did a good or bad job- the results were clear to see.\nFind a real activity with real results §\nLike woodworking, there are many activities that scratch this itch. \nAnd we’re starting to understand all the benefits of these activities.\n\nToday, more and more of our work is conceptual- and very subjective.\nCoaching can be one of them. It’s hard to tell if I’m doing it well. Same thing with being a team manager, or a corporate CEO. When things don’t work- you can talk your way out of it and explain what went wrong.\nBut real activities with real results give it to us clear.\nReal Activities help us feel grounded, calm, and can help reduce pain §\nAll sorts of activities count here- even things like knitting and crafting.\nIn his newsletter on movement, Todd Hargrove talks about how many people who have these kinds of hobbies find themselves in a ‘flow state.’ It’s that feeling when the world just slips away, time slows down and you can fully immerse yourself in what you’re doing.\nReal activities can get us into the flow state consistently.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111281849--Placebo-Notes":{"title":"202111281849- Placebo Notes","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202111281849- Placebo Notes\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nGoing down a Placebo rabbit hole §\nThe human body is weird.\nI encountered an article this week about how just thinking you got a good night’s sleep actually improves your cognitive performance. I’m very careful around the claim that “your perception is your reality,” but I also have to admit that our minds are really powerful when it comes to influencing how we act in the world.\nWhat is placebo sleep and what should I do about it? §\nIt seems that the idea of placebo sleep is rooted in this one study from 2014. As far as I can tell, it’s the only major study on the topic.\n\nIn the study,\n(1) they asked participants to rate how they slept the night before\n(2) gave them a quick 5-minute lesson on sleep and REM cycles\nthen the placebo part:\n(3) Hooked them up to machine (that does nothing), “measured” their sleep, and then told them their previous night’s rest was just what they needed\nIn the experiment, the belief that you got enough sleep was enough to boost cognitive performance as if you had actually slept well the night before.\nMy 2 big takeaways from the study §\n#1 Education about how the body works plays a big part in health.\nThe days when coaches and doctors could just talk down to their patients are gone.\nI learned this firsthand when I was experiencing chronic pain. The first step on my path to recovery was educating myself on how pain works (4min). Through that I became less anxious and fearful, and I could take care of my health better\nWhen it comes to health- teaching someone how their body works is important. And communicating it well is a skill that coaches need to learn.\n#2 Relying on ‘objective’ trackers can backfire. There’s merit to subjective measurement\nIn the past, I was obsessed with tracking my sleep data on my smartwatch.\nSome days, I would wake up feeling good, but my watch would tell me that I didn’t sleep enough. Then everything would backfire. I would get anxious. I would second guess my sleep. I would worry about making it up the next night.\nBy focusing on your overall sleep experience (1min) and not just the data, you can improve the quality of your sleep and feel more rested when you get up in the mornin\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111281850--Health-and-Wealth":{"title":"202111281850- Health and Wealth","links":["","tags/permanent-note"],"tags":["permanent-note"],"content":"topic: 202111281850- Health and Wealth\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThe common factor between growing wealth and practicing health §\nThis week is one my own writing.\nSomeone shared with me a podcast with Morgan Housel, the author of The Psychology of Money. I couldn’t help but see the parallels between building health and developing the mindset for lifelong health.\nI wrote this Twitter post on how this applies to ex-athletes. And the response was very positive from a lot of other people too.\nSo here’s a more generalized version of the ideas I wrote about.\n#1 We overlook the benefits of the compounding effect §\nThe classic story here is the one of the chessboard and the doubling grain of rice. I’ve heard this many times. I studied Mathematics in college. I know it’s true, and it still feels counterintuitive. \nI think the paradigm shift here is not thinking of it in terms of losses or gains, but in terms of making your base bigger. If you make your goal a 1% increase, that feels like very little. (see also: James Clear on 1% better). But the trick is in how much you start with.\nIf you start at 10, 1% of that is 1,\nbut 1% of 100 is 10,\n1% of 1000 is 100…\nYou get the idea.\nIf you’re starting out at 1, that’s great. Gain 1% slowly and steadily, and before you know it, you’re working with such a big base that health growth becomes easier and steadier.\n#2 We compare ourselves to others too much §\nI’m guilty of this myself.\nAs an ex-athlete, I’m always trying to compete with other people. We see other people who look further along than us, and it feels discouraging. We don’t even want to start our own journeys.\nMorgan Housel writes about Internal and External Benchmarks. \nIf you’re measuring yourself against other people (External Benchmarks) you’ll always find someone who seems more healthier, stronger, and further along their health journey.\nInstead focus on Internal Benchmarks. Understand what your values are, and what makes you happy. That can be the measure of your progress\n#3 Avoid extremes and seek balance §\nIn order the get the benefits of the compounding effect, you have to be consistent.\nWe have this tendency to be all or nothing. We set big goals, push hard for a while and then stop abandon them when things get hard.\nInstead, plan around the highs and lows. When things are good, take advantage, and brace yourself for challenging times. When things are challenging, do the minimums, get through, and be ready for when things lighten up.\nThe trick is to be consistent, and never hit pause on your practices.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111281948--Dunning-Kruger":{"title":"202111281948- Dunning Kruger","links":["","tags/permanent-note","tags/on/knowledge","tags/learning","tags/imposter-syndrome"],"tags":["permanent-note","on/knowledge","learning","imposter-syndrome"],"content":"topic: 202111281948- Dunning Kruger\nalias:\ntags:#permanent-note#on/knowledge#learning#imposter-syndrome §\nMy writing (250-300 words) §\nThe more I know, the more I feel like I don’t know §\nI didn’t study biomechanics, or sports science, or physical therapy. I don’t actually have any degrees that apply to coaching fitness.\nI’m constantly hounded by this feeling that I’m not ‘qualified enough’ to be a coach- and that I’m just faking it.

Most people have this idea that being fit means looking good, and moving well. And while those are nice things to have, it’s better to root your practice in things that might matter more to you.\nWhat would being fit mean for you? \nIt could be:\n\nI’ll be strong enough to travel, enjoy my hobbies\nI have the energy work and be creative\nI can play with my kids (and grandkids)\n\nThese kinds of things are what really motivate us to exercise.

He’s a coach who is obsessed with the words we use when teaching movement.\nHis main idea is that the words that we use matter. It has a measurable effect on our performance. This is most useful for coaches. But even if you’re a regular person trying to move better, there are a few takeaways to help you here.\nHere are some quick principles from my first jump in.\n\n1. Use an external cue §\nInstead of saying “lift your arms more” (internal cue), try saying instead “push towards the ceiling.” (external cue) The reason this works is that with an internal cue you zone in on one body part, and the body as a whole coordinates less. But with an external cue, your whole body focuses on that goal, and the body coordinates better.\n2. Use metaphors and images §\nApart from external cues, using images and metaphors also helps the body coordinate. Try using different images when you’re doing movements.\n\n“Take of like a plane” when you’re sprinting\n“Bounce like a gazelle” when jumping\n“Sit back into a chair” when doing a squat\n\nHear Nick Winkelman talk about it here\n3. Get into Trial and Error §\nBecause we’re using metaphors and images, there’s a bit of trial and error involved. We have different images in our head. Some metaphors might work better for you than others. It becomes more of an art than a science at this point. Trying different things and experimenting is the name of the game.\n\nContinue to these notes (next) §\nDive Deeper with these notes (deeper into this) §\nRelated to (go sideways- parallel ideas) §\nSource §"},"Notes/202111290749--Movement-over-exercise":{"title":"202111290749- Movement over exercise","links":["Notes/202201252136--Health,-Culture,-and-National-security","Automation-is-coming--here's-what-that-means-for-movement"],"tags":["-movement-exercise-on/technology-"],"content":"My writing (250-300 words) §\nThe one reason you should stop exercising and start moving\n—\nTechnology doesn’t save time, it actually saves movement\nPeople think of technology as gadgets and devices that make life more convenient.

But we think convenient means more productive.

But now, there are machines can do that also. Look at every machine in your life- and see how it’s outsourcing movement in some way. The telelphone is outsourcing the walk to the neighbors.

But if you zoom out, and view your goals from a big picture, you can see how your goals connect to one another.\nImagine 3 levels of Goals: The Super-goal, the Intermediate-Goal, the Sub-Goal §\nOur goals fall into one of these 3:\n\nIf the super goal is “I want to be healthy”\nThe intermediate goals are “To be physically strong,” “To avoid stress,” and “To eat well”\nThen sub-goals are “Exercise 15 minutes a day,” “Eat a handful of greens at dinner,” AKA your smart goals\n\nSee how your goals connect and expect it to be non-linear! §\nThat’s because a sub-goal can link to more than 1 intermediate goal. And an intermediate goal can link to more than 1 super goal.\nBecause health is interconnected, you can expect one practice to benefit the others also. It’s not a simple IF-THIS-THEN-THAT. You can experience benefits in many areas at once with health practices.\nAnd it helps to see it all laid out.\nSeeing the network shows you different paths to work on your health §\nWith your Goal Network, even when motivation is low, you can stay on track.\nBecause many Sub-Goals can get you to your Super-Goal.

So if this sounds like something you’d like to work toward, participate in a cohort of Ship 30 for 30 to start creating your library of content online and gathering data/analytics on “what’s working.” Alumni are then invited to join The Captain’s Table after they’ve completed at least one cohort of Ship 30 for 30.\nBut until then, we wanted to give you a framework for turning FREE readers into PAID customers.\nAnd the framework goes like this…\nDigital Writing Fast-Track Framework Of The Week: §\nIn order for readers to feel like you are someone worth investing their time, attention, and money into, they need a few questions answered.\nSpecifically, they need 8 questions answered.\nAnd if you can deliver on these 8 questions (in your free content, in the introduction of your book/course, on your landing page, etc.), the likelihood they want to keep investing more in their relationship with you and your content goes up exponentially.\nHere’s the roadmap:\nQuestion #1: Who Are YOU? §\nIf you say, “Hey you,” the reader doesn’t know if you’re talking to them or not.\nAnd if you say, “Hey, mom,” the reader sort of assumes you’re talking to them but they also aren’t quite sure.\nBut if you say, “Hey single-mom struggling to maintain her sanity while raising 2 kids, and dad is at work all day, and you’re stressed about the bills, and you haven’t had a healthy meal in who-knows-how-long,” WOW, that very specific audience knows you’re talking to her and only her.\nAnd that’s the goal.\nThe more specific you can be about who your WHO is, the more likely your target WHO will trust you (because they feel seen, heard, and understood).\nState your WHO.\nQuestion #2: Where is your target reader stuck in Struggle City? §\nImagine your target reader is stuck.\nStuck in Struggle City.\nThey are experiencing 5 huge problems. What are they? Do you know? Can you list them out? How specific can you get?\nAnd what are the causes of these problems? Where do they come from? How does your target reader feel about them? What’s the urgency? How badly do they wish these problems were gone? (If the problems aren’t very urgent or important, then you aren’t talking about the right problems!)\nList the 5 biggest problems your target reader faces today.\nQuestion #3: Who can they blame? §\nThis is sales copywriting 101.\nNever make the customer blame themselves. (When was the last time someone pointed out a problem in your life, where you were the main culprit, and you didn’t get defensive?)\nInstead, give the customer someone/something else to blame.\n\nCan they blame their teachers? Maybe they weren’t given the right information.\nCan they blame their surroundings? Maybe they aren’t in a supportive environment.\nCan they blame their prior purchases? Maybe those promised things but didn’t deliver.\n\nThe point is: the customer needs to feel the urgency to change without feeling bad about themselves and their lack of progress to-date. (This is their “golden bridge” they can retreat on to leave Struggle City for good.)\nGive them something to blame.\nQuestion #4: What are the myths holding them back from making progress? §\nThe reader is ready to change.\nBut they probably have a bunch of “myths” swirling around in their heads helping them rationalize staying stuck in Struggle City.\n\nWhat advice do “most people” give them, and why is it wrong?\nWhat stats do “most people” not know, and how can you educate them?\nWhat beliefs do “most people” internalize, that are doing them a disservice?\n\nThe more you can pull back the curtain and give readers “an insider’s take” on what’s really going on, the more they will see you as the trusted source of truth.\nCall out the myths.\nQuestion #5: What’s the unlikely answer? §\nGiving people obvious solutions to their problems doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence.\nImagine going to Home Depot and saying you don’t know how to build a shed but want to create one, and the guy says, “Well, we’ve got some wood.”\nBoring.\nInstead, you want to give readers (who you want to inspire to turn into customers) the unlikely solution.\nSo instead of saying, “Well, we’ve got wood,” you want to say, “Did you know you can order a ready-to-live shed straight to your door? It comes pre-made for you.”\nAmazing!\nGive the reader the unlikely answer (the thing they weren’t expecting) and 99% of the time, they’ll want more.\nQuestion #6: What are the benefits of this “road less traveled?” §\nYou’ve told them why they’re stuck in Struggle City…\nYou’ve given them someone/something else to blame…\nYou’ve pulled back the curtain and debunked the myths…\nAnd you’ve given them an “unlikely answer,” unlocking the road less traveled…\nNow it’s time to paint the rainbow at the end.\n\nWhat will the reader experience if they take this less-known road?\nWhat are the benefits of going the opposite way as everyone else?\n\nTell them about the pot of gold!\nQuestion #7: What does their life look like “on the other side?” §\nAh, glory.\nIn order for the reader to make the commitment to go on this journey, they need to know it’ll all be worth it.\nSo, don’t hold back. Tell them everything. Tell them what their life will be like. Tell them all the things that will be different (for good and bad). Be honest. Tell them what they can expect to find, who they can expect to meet, and what they can expect to feel. Paint the vision. Give it to them in 4K, HD.\nHelp them visualize the dream.\nQuestion #8: “Are you ready to transform?” §\nFinally, you have to call the reader to adventure.\nDon’t bury the ask.\nDon’t “assume” they’ll take it upon themselves to figure out how to get started.\nTell them, point blank, “Here’s the first step.” Take them by the hand and show them the way. Be their guide, their mentor. Take care of them. Show (no, PROVE!) that you’ve got them, and you won’t let anything bad happen to them along the way.\nAsk them, “Are you ready to transform?”\nYour Weekly Digital Writing Prompt §\nNot sure what to write about today?\nHere’s a prompt to get the creative juices flowing:\nWhat is your favorite memory as a child?\nIf a moment come rushing back into mind, follow it.

It’s the right thing for the right job.\nBeing fit means that something is adapted. It belongs in its environment. It isn’t out of place. It’s not useless and it’s not extra.\nI think of marathon running as a great example for this. There is no instance in your life, when running a marathon will ever be practical. Yes, it can give you a good sense of accomplishment. Yes it can be a great achievement. But I’m 99% percent sure, you’ll never have to run 42km in a day.\nWe don’t have to hunt for our food anymore. We don’t have to run away from lions.\nUnderstanding the demands of your life §\nAsk yourself then: What do I need to be fit for?\nIt’s a big over arching question, that can be vague and hard to answer. I can break it down into a few more questions.\n\nWhat are the physical demands of your work?\n\nAre you lifting heavy things?\nAre you on your feet?\nAre you hunched over all the time? (That’s physical)\n\n\nWhat about the physical demands of your hobbies?\n\nDo you play basketball on weekends?\nDo you like to go hiking or diving?\nDo you like to go on walks?\n\n\nWho benefits from you being fit?\n\nI can play with my pets\nI can play with my kids\nI can help me wife do work around the house\n\n\nWhat kind of activity would you like to do in 20 years? in 30 years?\n\nI’d like to still be walking every day\nI’d like to be climbing mountains when I’m old\nI’d like to be lifting weights as an old man\n\n\n\nYour answers to these questions might give you some idea of what you’re trying to be fit for. And thus, what fitness looks like to you.\nMaking yourself fit to that §\nIf you understand the goal, and you understand the constraints that you have. Then you can start to make some decision that will help your fitness.\nSay from the questions above, I say. My work is sitting at my computer writing all day. But as a hobby I like to do gardening. I mainly want to benefit my wife by being handy around the house, and as I age, I’d like to still be active, walking, maybe running, playing with kids and grandkids.\nAll these give me the constraits to fit my program towards.\n\nI would try to work on the strain from writing\nI would try to be strong enough to lift soil bags\nI would try to be mobile enough to bend down while working in the garden\nI want to have enough cardio health to be able to walk and run\n\nBut if from the questions above, I say: My work is in a restaurant, and I’m always on my feet. I love trianing for marathons, and I want to help other people run too. As I age, I’d still like to be running long distances.\nThen for me, what it means to be fit is:\n\nI work on my knees and other running muslces\nI think about the long term health of my running\n\nNo one fitness program is good for everyone.\nIn none of the above examples does being fit entail lifting 100s of pouds in bench presses. (That may be fit for some people, but not for everyone). So you can be living a very simple, modest exercise life, and still be very fit!\nFitness is just that. How suited is your workout to your lifestlye.\nRedefining fitness for yourself §\nThis kind of fitness changes over time too.\nAs you grow,\nAnd your life changes.\nWhat it means to be fit changes with it also.\nThis is just the natural progressionof things."},"Notes/A-List-of-My-Favorite-Things":{"title":"A List of My Favorite Things","links":["Frank-Ambrosio","Notes/Hollow-Knight-(story)"],"tags":[],"content":"A List of My Favorite Things §\n\n\nOnline Dante Course\n\nIt actually works like an online illuminated manuscript.\nWhich is such an amazing concept \nby: [Frank Ambrosio]\n\n\n\nHollow Knight (story)\n\nThis game is just brilliant to me\nThe storytelling.

The promise had been a significant part of the political campaign.\nWhat makes this story particularly noteworthy is the work of independent journalist Michael, who dedicated himself to uncovering the truth. Michael’s investigative efforts brought him into contact with many farmers, allowing him to gather firsthand accounts and insights.\nIn an era where journalism is undergoing transformation, independent journalists like Michael continue to be vital contributors to society.

Why? Because over time, the backlinks will overpopulate like weeds, covering up the more valuable connections by their sheer numbers.\nIt’s the same thing that happened to many people in Evernote who saved too many articles.

Over time, you end up scrolling and wasting more and more time hunting for meaningful links amidst all the noise of all the false-positives.

The resulting fall of blood glucose levels causes hunger, irritability, and energy crashes.\nAverage Diet — Even an average diet can still have several micro-nutrient deficiencies that can be the cause of headaches, lower Energy (re Flow) levels, mood swings, a lack of enthusiasm.\nLack of Enthusiasm (re Flow)\nLack of Direction (re Flow)\n\nSolutions to Poor Attention §\n\nReducing Distractions in Intensity and Frequency\nHaving a Good Diet\n"},"Notes/Augmenting-Long-Term-Memory":{"title":"Augmenting Long Term Memory","links":[],"tags":["-learning-memory-"],"content":"http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html"},"Notes/Autonomous-vehicles":{"title":"Autonomous vehicles","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Autonomous vehicles §\nThis was about designing objects that respond to their environments\nThis was in the context of computer programming.\nVehicles\nA book:\nExperiments in synthetic psychology\nby Valentino braitenberg"},"Notes/Autonomy-according-to-GMB":{"title":"Autonomy according to GMB","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Autonomy according to GMB §\nContext §\nThis is a really good idea for me\nThe way they articulate it §\nSource §\n\n\n\nKey Idea §\n\nBeing able to do the things you want to do\nTraining for the life you want to live\nAutonomy is freedom.\n\nI’m in control\nI can make decisions.\n\n\nI’m not held back by my body.\nI can do the things that I want to do\n"},"Notes/Avoid-Overtraining-by-Logging":{"title":"Avoid Overtraining by Logging","links":["Notes/A-Second-brain-for-your-workouts","Notes/Brain-is-for-having-ideas-not-for-holding-them"],"tags":[],"content":"Avoid overtraining with a log §\nContext §\nOvertraining happens to some people\nWhat is it §\nLogging\nWhat am I keeping track off\nI find logging really hard and challenging.\nIt gets boring;

The key to sustainable progress lies in adopting a “builder mindset.” This mindset is not just about constructing something new but also about understanding the foundational ‘why’ behind each action.\nTo maintain this balance, especially for those who naturally lean towards a more relaxed approach, it’s crucial to continually interrogate your ‘why.’ Start with the immediate reason and keep asking “why do I care about that?” until you reach the core motivation. This exercise serves as a compass, ensuring that you’re aligned with your deepest values and objectives, thereby enabling you to operate optimally in “builder mode.”\nThis is not just a mental exercise but a tool for recalibration.

Below is a list of benefits derived from having your notes equipped with fluid frameworks like a Home note and Maps of Content.\n\nBenefits §\nProvides Reliability §\nHaving a Home note and MOCs act as reliable home bases to re-ground your thoughts whenever they begin to waver. Like a parent to a five-year old, linked frameworks like MOCs are a consistent and comforting safety net.\nDisregard this at your own peril.  1\nProvides Flexibility §\n\nFluid Frameworks like the Home note and Maps of Content don’t limit access; they curate it.\n\nThey are like a top-notch concierge that directs you to where you want to be.\nSee Why Categories for Your Notes are a Good Idea.\nLaunches the Brain §\nThe LYT framework is filled with your personalized reminders of important categories of knowledge and their key terms. It helps kickstart the brain—reducing the activation energy needed to start thinking and connecting ideas.\nEnhances Note Retrieval §\nNote retrieval becomes easier when you’re staring at many possible access points: your main categories, contexts, maps, and tags. 2 Notes become tethered like Wolverine:\n\nAlleviates Overwhelm §\nMOCs Overview (MOCs) are your key to adding structure to the chaos, especially as your digital library grows. The ability to sense the tickle of anxiety and build an MOC is oftentimes the difference between a finished project and an abandoned one.\nEncourages Relational, Positional Thinking §\nMaking a Map of Content forces a rich, engaging relational battle between notes. Notes jockey for position in your brain, and each placement by you embeds them with additional meaning.\nAids in Linking with Pre-built Contexts §\nYour 10 or so main maps provide a pre-built latticework upon which to hang your new notes. It’s a personalized classification system for your digital knowledge. Tethering to these hub-like maps vastly enhance long-term storage and retrieval.\nFuture-Proofs for your Future Self §\nThere are months that go by where I don’t open my digital library. Before adopting plain text and adding structure, I would get anxiety when I would finally re-open it. Now, however, I don’t get that anxiety because I have my trusty Home note, Maps of Content and other fluid ways of categorizing and retrieving info. In no time, I’m back up to speed and off to the races.\nImproves Memory §\nTransclude of block dbdd21\nBecause of the well-traveled structural pathways that the Home note and Maps of Content encourage, my recall has improved. This makes sense because of three important factors that working with “linked frameworks” encourages:\n\nReps - I’m constantly returning to a home view and then re-launching into new directions in my digital library.\nConceptual Thinking - Making MOCs forces you to really consider the unique qualities of the thought you’re holding and how it relates to other thoughts. This conceptual [[thinking through linking]] strengthens neural connections—making Cobwebs into Cables.\nSpatial Context - Your main MOCs are numbered and always at the top of the sidebar (when sorted A to Z). This way, they act as a spatial map. We remember things much better when we have a spatial constellation of related things.\n\nIncreases Satisfaction §\nWe spend too much time with our notes not to experience joy with them. LYT structures allow you to fly around your digital library with the deftness of a surgeon and the joy of a chimpanzee swinging from branch to branch.\n%%\n\nDid you know this article is LIVE online right now, but no one online can see these hidden “comments” except us :)\nWow, this note uses at least 18 different formatting methods:\ninternal links, embeds, headers, dividers, emphasis with bolds, italics, bold+italics, lists, images, piped links, external links, blockquotes, inline code, tables, strikethroughs, highlights, footnotes, and comments. \n\nThe first three benefits as a table §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefitDescriptionProvides ReliabilityReliable places to ground thoughtsProvides FlexibilityFluid frameworks don’t limit, they curateLaunches the BrainJump Kickstarts your brain\n%%\n\nNext §\nThe benefits are exhaustive—and we haven’t even talked about Idea Emergence!\nBut you may still be asking: Is LYT For Me?\nFootnotes §\n\n\nDo not underestimate the peace of mind that comes from a reliable, dependable digital library.

A five-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and a 12-time NBA All-Star, he was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty that won 11 NBA championships during his 13-year career.[2] Russell and Henri Richard of the National Hockey League are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.[3] Russell is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He led the San Francisco Dons to two consecutive NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956,[4] and he captained the gold-medal winning U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[5]\nDespite his limitations on offense, as Russell averaged 15.1 points per game, his rebounding, defense, and leadership made him one of the dominant players of his era.[6][7][8][9] Standing at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall, with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) arm span,[10][11] his shot-blocking and man-to-man defense were major reasons for the Celtics’ dominance during his career. Russell was equally notable for his rebounding abilities, and he led the NBA in rebounds four times, had a dozen consecutive seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds,[12] and remains second all time in both total rebounds and rebounds per game. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival Wilt Chamberlain) to have grabbed more than 50 rebounds in a game.[13]\nRussell played in the wake of black pioneers Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, and Sweetwater Clifton, and he was the first black player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as player-coach for the Celtics, becoming the first black coach in the NBA and the first to win a championship.[14] In 2011, Barack Obama awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments on the court and in the civil rights movement.[15]\nRussell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, was one of the founding inductees into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. He was selected into the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971 and the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[5] one of only four players to receive all three honors, and selected into the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. In 2009, the NBA renamed the NBA Finals MVP Award in his honor.[16] In 2021, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame a second time for his coaching career.[17] Shortly after his death in 2022, the NBA retired Russell’s jersey number 6 league-wide, becoming the only player in NBA history to receive the honor.[18]"},"Notes/Biodynamic-Farming-in-the-Philippinies":{"title":"Biodynamic Farming in the Philippinies","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/soil","tags/composting"],"tags":["idea-note","soil","composting"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#soil#composting\nurl: https://www.downtoearth.ph/biodynamic-composting/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nWe get ours from Greg Kitma of PhilBio\nSee also §"},"Notes/Bitcoin-perhaps-is-more-like-jewelery-that-currency":{"title":"Bitcoin perhaps is more like jewelery that currency","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Bitcoin perhaps is more like jewelery that currency"},"Notes/Black-Soldier-Fly-Resources":{"title":"Black Soldier Fly Resources","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://www.evoconsys.com/blog/house-fly-inhibition-by-black-soldier-fly-how-do-they-do-it\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00987968\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Grow-Black-Soldier-Flies\nhttps://kimmyfarm.com/en/black-soldier-flies-calcium-worm-breeding-techniques\nhttps://www.thecritterdepot.com/blogs/news/how-to-breen-black-soldier-fly-larvae"},"Notes/Blind-guy-Travels-podcast-(story)":{"title":"Blind guy Travels podcast (story)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Blind guy travels (podcast) §\nCan’t make facial expressions\nBecause he can’t copy\nWhich is inate to us\nThis is why blind people have a bit of that blank expression.\nIt’s something that I took for granted\nBecause you don’t even think about how you copy facial expressions"},"Notes/Blockchain-and-search-engines":{"title":"Blockchain and search engines","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1406400770581303297\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Blockchains-and-Transparency":{"title":"Blockchains and Transparency","links":["Maps/Web3-MOC","Notes/The-trap-of-giving-up-religion-for-science","Notes/Science-can-be-just-as-cherry-picky-as-religion"],"tags":[],"content":"up:: Web3 MOC\nX:: The trap of giving up religion for science\ntags:: web3\nnovelty::\nLink to Reference §\nurl: Interview: Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum\nKey Ideas §\nLike what democracies aspire to be, a blockchain is highly open and transparent, and anyone can verify that the rules are being followed.

But if you’re feeling relaxed, your mind reflects that in your body also.\nThis plays a big role when it comes to injury and recovery.\nOne of the most well-known examples of the mind-body connection is the placebo effect. \nThis is when someone takes a “fake” treatment, like a sugar pill, but experiences real health benefits because they believe the treatment will work.\nPlacebo effects have been documented in a variety of studies and are now considered an important part of many medical treatments.\nSo, what does all this mean for you?\nIt means you have to practice some mental fitness as a part of your recovery process\n—\nWe all have inner saboteurs. \nThese are the voices inside our heads that tell us we’re not good enough, that we can’t do it, or that we’re going to fail. \nIt’s the voice of fear, or the voice of perfectionism, or even the judging voice that we all have. (This is in everybody, it’s okay and there’s nothing wrong with that in itself)\nRemember back in the previous video, we talked about the physical pain we experience. Physical pain is not bad- it has a useful function for survival and keeping safe. It’s becomes a problem when it goes overboard.\nThe same thing with our inner saboteur voices.\nWhen it comes to your body and injuries- it’s that voice that tries everything to keep you from your recovery.\nThat voice might tell you that your body is weak, and not recovered. It might tell you that you’re going to injure yourself again if you get back into exercise and activity.\nSometimes that voice will tell you that you were stupid to get yourself injured in the first place! (My voice does this all the time) It tells me that I was being dumb and always putting myself in danger. I would be better off if I didn’t do anything instead.\nYour voice might say that it’s not important to you right now, and that you can put it off for next time. There are all sorts of excuses that your saboteur can use to keep you from taking action and getting out of an injured mindset.\nSo next time you hear your inner saboteur speaking, remember that it’s the voice of fear. It has a role, but it cannot control your whole life.\n–\nWhat should you do instead?\nIn the same way you have an inner saboteur that sabotages you, you also have an inner sage.\nYou can call it many things- your true self, your best self, even your inner coach.\nYour sage is the part of that knows what you need to do. It comes from a place of calm, trust and wisdom. The challenge is that we are out of practice when it comes to listening to that sage wisdom.\nBecause of the many things in our environment or society.\nSo if you’re having trouble with your injury. And it keeps bringing up anxiety, perfectionism, and other negative thought patterns. You can practice listening to your inner sage.\nInstead of letting your saboteurs win, start learning to trust your inner sage. \n–\nRemember, when it comes to your recovery the mind is a powerful tool that can work for or against you.\nYou might say, isn’t this a self fulfilling prophecy? If I’m optimistic and positive, then of course things will improve.\nbut if I’m negative and stuck in saboteurs thinking, then I’ll go in that direction also.\nThe answer is yes and no. It is a self fulfilling prophecy in the sense that what we focus on develops. While what we ignore gets weaker.\nMy favorite image to think about this is a trail in the woods. I like to go on on hikes, and sometimes I find myself in a place where the trail is bad and difficult. The problem is that I don’t have a better path to take- so I stick to the bad path. \nIt’s a lot of hard work to forge a new and better path when I’m on a hike. But if I have a guide, we can plan out a good route together. Plus, once I get on a good path once- the next time, I’ll have an easier time finding it.\nOver time, if I follow the good path enough- I start to remember how to get there. The trail becomes easier to spot. My hike becomes a lot easier.\nLetting ourselves get taken over by negative saboteur thinking gets us stuck in that bad path. For injuries, it can be believing that things will never get better. Or that our bodies will never be the same again.\nIf we focus on negativity, we will trap ourselves in that negative thinking pattern.\nBut, it is also true that we have the power to choose our thoughts and emotions. By choosing to listen to our wise sage, we can start to forge a new and better path to recovery. It is challenging for sure, especially in the beginning. But over time it gets easier and easier.\n–\nFor now, it is good to explore- what are some of the negative ideas I have surrounding my body and my injury?\nDon’t worry about getting rid of those thoughts right now. Like many important things, it takes time and practice.\nBut being aware of the negative saboteur thoughts that keep coming to you is a great first step. By having those in mind, and even writing them down- you’ll setting yourself up for choosing a better path in the future.\n**"},"Notes/Building-your-own-health-system":{"title":"Building your own health system","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1485206537455149059 §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nAt the end of the day, you can’t just copy-paste someone else’s health system and expect it to work for you.

There are good reasons for your body and your mind to resist the change\nThat reminds me that Why we always resist change. And for good reason. It’s so that the brain can be more efficient and take shortcuts.\nIt’s important because if you understand what your brain is doing, then you can understand why you resist change so much!\n\nRead more at: Why Change Is so Hard — and How to Deal with It\nGo one level up : Learning MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Path dependence"},"Notes/Changing-a-habit-is-really-about-replacing-a-routine":{"title":"Changing a habit is really about replacing a routine","links":["Notes/Defining-a-habit","tags/habit","Natural-Selection","Notes/Habit-formation-provides-an-evolutionary-advantage","Notes/How-Atomic-Habits-fit-into-the-conversation-on-habits"],"tags":["habit"],"content":"up:: Defining a habit\ntags::#habit\nChanging a habit is really about replacing a routine §\nDuhigg’s book, while full of the requisite filler of long pop-science stories, breaks ground on providing a simple habit formation process.1\nHabits are incredibly resilient: in some cases, people with extensive brain damage who could not even remember where they lived could still adhere to their old habits and pick up new ones. This is because learning and maintaining habits happens in the basal ganglia, a part of your brain that can function normally even if the rest of your brain is damaged.\nUnfortunately, this resilience means that even if you kick a bad habit, like smoking, you will always be at risk of relapsing.\nHabits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort and therefore endure. They are Natural Selection in action. See: Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage.\nHabits stick because they create craving.\n\ngolden rule of changing any habit: don’t resist craving, redirect it\n\ndo this by keeping the cue and the reward and just replacing the routine.\n\n\n\nWhat Keystone Habits are really about, and probably why I’ve always struggled with the term, 1 is because behavioral change is really driven by small wins—ie early victories that are relatively easy to reach. Therefore it’s “small wins” and not “keystone habits” that help you viscerally believe that change is possible.\nWhat Duhigg—and over 500 research articles who referenced Baumeister’s work—got wrong: “Willpower is the most important keystone habit.” No, it’s not. This finding, which is false, directed my attentions for the next several years, only to realize that willpower is way, way overrated and the studies were rotten (looking at you Baumeister!).\nFollowing habits is not only a key part of our lives but also a key part of organizations and companies. All habits comprise a cue-routine-reward loop, and the easiest way to change this is to substitute the routine for something else while keeping the cue and reward the same. Achieving lasting change in life is difficult, but it can be done by focusing on important keystone habits such as willpower.\nFootnotes §\n\n\nToo simple perhaps, because in making the process super sticky with only 3 steps, he left out an important fourth step between Cue and Routine: Craving.

This notion resonates with the idea that “homo cinematicus is homo ludens,” revealing the profound impact of cinema on our lives.\nDirectorial styles can be likened to different liturgies, each offering a distinct lens through which we perceive truth. While this concept applies to cinema as a whole, some auteurs embody it with exceptional clarity. Wes Anderson, for instance, unmistakably captures our senses, drawing us into his vivid and meticulously crafted worlds. His films, in a sense, become rites of passage, inviting us to engage more deeply.\nBut Wes Anderson is not alone in this endeavor. Other directors, like Paul Schrader, bring their unique perspectives to the cinematic ritual. Schrader’s exploration of reality through his lens adds yet another layer to the tapestry of cinematic liturgy. It’s through these directors and their distinctive visions that we can appreciate the full spectrum of human experience in the world of cinema.\n\nRead more at: Wes Anderson’s Chafings Against the Immanent Frame: An Addendum | Church Life Journal | University of Notre Dame\nGo one level up : Spirituality MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The Disappearing Art Of Maintenance"},"Notes/Circular-saw-for-steel":{"title":"Circular saw for steel","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Circular saw for steel §\nRemember, you can’t use your woodworking mitre saw for steel!\nVincenzo Karpintero talks about this.\nYou can’t just use the same circular saw.\nI think when the time comes, I’ll just ask for help from Vincenzo!"},"Notes/Classic-psychedelics-in-the-treatment-of-substance-use-disorder-Potential-synergies-with-twelve-step-programs":{"title":"Classic psychedelics in the treatment of substance use disorder Potential synergies with twelve-step programs","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353485146_Classic_psychedelics_in_the_treatment_of_substance_use_disorder_Potential_synergies_with_twelve-step_programs\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nSee also §"},"Notes/Coaches-Need-Coaches":{"title":"Coaches Need Coaches","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coaches need coaches\nhttps://twitter.com/JLPGomez/status/1438290329694785537"},"Notes/Cobra-Effect-in-British-India-(analogy)":{"title":"Cobra Effect in British India (analogy)","links":["Notes/Goodhart's-Law-(mental-models)"],"tags":[],"content":"Cobra Effect in British India §\nOptimizing to one metric,\ncan affect your overall performance.\nLet’s say the metric is\nI want to run a 10k in under 30 minutes\nYou might ignore some things in order to push those boundaries\nProblem solving the wrong way\nTeaching to the test\nCreates bad applications\nThis is teaching to the test\nand there are many manifestations of this\nSee also\nGoodhart’s Law (mental models)"},"Notes/Cobwebs-into-Cables":{"title":"Cobwebs into Cables","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/concept","Notes/Reps"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#concept\nCobwebs into Cables §\nTurning cobwebs into cables is a metaphor for strengthening neural connections through getting Reps.\n\n“Neurons that fire together wire together” - Hebb’s Rule\n"},"Notes/Coccygodynia":{"title":"Coccygodynia","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coccygodynia §\nKey Idea §\n\nThis is a tailbone thing\nI’m researching it for Alexa\n\nPiriformis Stretch\nLunge type (can be lying down)\nHamstring\nIntertwist and stretch"},"Notes/Coffeehouse-as-a-kind-of-penny-Univeristy":{"title":"Coffeehouse as a kind of penny Univeristy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Coffeehouse as a kind of penny Univeristy §\nBut a cup of coffee\nAnd the learn from the people around you"},"Notes/Cognitive-Functional-Therapy-1":{"title":"Cognitive Functional Therapy 1","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: http://www.pain-ed.com/blog/2019/04/18/cft-infographic/\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nThis is the pain infographic that’s so good\nAnd so that if I search pain infographic this will show up for sure\nSee also §"},"Notes/Cognitive-Functional-Therapy":{"title":"Cognitive Functional Therapy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Notes/Cohabitation-is-a-luxury-belief":{"title":"Cohabitation is a luxury belief","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/marriage","tags/cohabitation","tags/luxury-belief","Notes/Luxury-Beliefs"],"tags":["idea-note","marriage","cohabitation","luxury-belief"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#marriage#cohabitation#luxury-belief\nurl: https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/no-one-expects-young-men-to-do-anything?s=r\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nRob Henderson’s stuff\nI like him because he’s a smart conservative\nKey Idea §\nThe idea that cohabiting partnerships are good is a luxury belief\nBecause if you you money, the problems that come with a cohabiting partnership not working out are less detrimental\nBut when people without money try to do this it doesn’t really work out as well for them\nSee also §\nLuxury Beliefs"},"Notes/CohereDAO-and-Inequality-and-Social-Justice":{"title":"CohereDAO and Inequality and Social Justice","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/on/coheredao","tags/consciousness","tags/local-community","tags/regenerative"],"tags":["idea-note","on/coheredao","consciousness","local-community","regenerative"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#on/coheredao#consciousness#local-community#regenerative\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/626a42d01239922546884a41\nhttps://www.airr.io/quote/626a4354123992254688bc44\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nI want to be conscious of this.

Are you clear on your direction? It’s worth noting that even if this activity isn’t part of your big goals in life, you can still be in flow as long as you are clear on what you’re doing in the moment. Essentially, you are clear on your next steps, your micro-direction, your micro-goals.\n\n\nClear and immediate feedback — How am I doing?\n\nClarity of Direction (re Flow) is the biggest factor here.\n\n\nA balance between perceived challenge and skill — If I’m not in flow, what can I do to help induce it?\n\nConceptually, this is the holy grail. Practically, you gotta deftly adjust your current situation. Technically, there are specific “recipes” to use that will help. Balancing Challenge and Skill is the most important condition because it’s the result of every element that dictates quality experience: Direction (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow), Attention (re Flow), and Energy (re Flow).\n\n\n\nNow that we have a clear list of the conditions of flow, we need to relate them to the Four Factors of Flow.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2012\ncreated:: 2012\nrevised:: 2014\nrevised:: 2016\nrevised:: 2019\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Connaturality-(idea)":{"title":"Connaturality (idea)","links":["Notes/Forming-Habits-(concept)","Notes/Misconception-when-it-comes-to-forming-habits"],"tags":[],"content":"public:: false\nConnaturality (concept) §\nHow things come easily for some people\nForming Habits (concept)\nIt’s\n\n\ncopy first\nI.e. find some good role models\nFind someone who’s style you like\nTry it on for size\n\n\nmake that a habit\nDo it regularly.\nThere’s no real science on how long this actually takes\nForming Habits (concept)\nMisconception when it comes to forming habits\nis about the misconcepcion of 21 days of learning\n\n\ndiscover your style\n\n\nbecome intuitive\n\n"},"Notes/Conscious-Creation-of-Health":{"title":"Conscious Creation of Health","links":["tags/idea-note","Notes/202111212045--Conscious-Health-Creation"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\n\nRiffing of Cole’s ideas\n\nKey Idea §\n\nIf you know the elements, then you can build it consciously, instead of stumbling upon good practices\nFour elements\n\nEnjoyment\nSocial\nHeart rate?\nNovelty?\n\n\n\nWhen people practice any fad diet.

Pushing myself as a writer has always been important to me, and I know that at River Tech, I’ll have the opportunity to grow and expand my skills while creating quality content for your team.\nDuring my time at Hawaii Western, I majored in English with an emphasis in Business Writing. This enabled me to focus on developing my technical writing skills. In fact, I was able to present my thesis not only at Hawaii Western but at a local conference as well. This assisted me not only in developing my writing abilities but in helping me hone my public speaking skills.\nMy previous position at Cloud Clearwater provided me with an incredible opportunity. I was able to revamp our company’s internal memo system to reflect updated verbiage and wording. Additionally, I participated in creating social media and digital platform content for the organization. This helped expand our social media following by over 50% in just three months.\nThank you for your time and consideration. As someone who is detail-oriented, driven, and dedicated to creating fantastic work, I’m looking forward to learning more about the Writer position at River Tech.

Do you follow the well-trodden trail, or carve your own? The lure of conformity is often strong; it’s the trail everyone else is taking, after all. But what if you create your own path, one laden with untapped opportunities?\nWhen you venture into uncharted waters, you might become the big fish in a small pond. Here’s where your accrued wisdom, your “knowledge of 100,” becomes a monumental advantage. In my own search for a sense of belonging and purpose, I’ve realized that facing unique challenges requires specialized solutions. You don’t want to be a generalist in a market full of specialists. Aim instead to be the specialist in a market that hasn’t even realized the need for one yet. In doing so, you’re not just outclassing the competition; you’re creating a new game altogether.\nThink about it: when you’re the pioneer, not only do you set the rules, but you also get to choose your competitors. Opt to play against those who are less sophisticated in the arena you’ve chosen. They may be experts in their fields, but if their expertise doesn’t extend to your particular pond, then you’ve instantly set yourself apart.\nImagine you’re a hunter-gatherer, and you’ve just discovered a forest abundant with game that your tribe hasn’t found yet. You know the hunting techniques, you’ve practiced them, and now you’ve found a place where these skills shine the brightest. You’re not just a hunter; you’re the go-to person for this new resource.\nBeing the big fish in a small pond isn’t about underestimating others but about maximizing your own capabilities and insights. It’s a conscious decision to apply your extensive knowledge to situations where it can make the most impact, thus increasing your chances of smart decisions without merely relying on luck.\n\nRead more at: How to Make Smart Decisions Without Getting Lucky\nGo one level up : Personal Brand MOC\nYou may also be interested in: 202208011440- What makes me different"},"Notes/Dedirot-effect":{"title":"Dedirot effect","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dedirot effect §\nBought more possessions story\nUpgrade everything\nIt’s when you end up buying more shit\nbecause you bought more shit\n** This is going to happen to us with this ridgeview house"},"Notes/Deep-Health-Workshop-(Talk)":{"title":"Deep Health Workshop (Talk)","links":["Notes/The-Value-of-a-Life-Dashboard"],"tags":[],"content":"What is Deep Health? §\nKey Idea 1: Your life is interconnected §\nAnalogy / Story §\nIn some schools they showed that those who exercise before class.\nScore better in the SATs\nIdea §\nWe mistakenly think that different aspects of our life are separate §\nWe tend to think that we can compartmentalize the aspects of our lives.\nSo when I go for a run, I feel “I’m benefiting my body.” Not my mind.\nOr when I’m reading a book, I say, “I’m improving my mind”\nOr now I’m going to spend time with friends, I’ll say “I’m working on my relationships.”\nWe think of things like boxes. Or like apps on a phone. §\nWe click one app and we do that one things. And then when we close the app it’s done.\nWorkout is one app.\nRelationships is another app.\nWhat we eat is a different app.\nThis approach is too compartmentalized\nInstead, I want you to think of health as something else altogether.\nWhat if health is more like trying to fall asleep.\nI’m going to sleep!!\nI need to sleep!!\nI want to sleep!!\nYou’re never going to fall asleep.\nThat’s never going to work.\nBut you have to tackle it indirectly.\nInstead of willfully working on something.\nYou have to work around it.\nAnd you’ll improve it.\nPulling on one string to move another (Leverage) §\nI can’t force my health to move in the right direction.\nBut I can tweak things around it.\nAnd make things move it.\nRue goldberg machine\nGears\nLeverage\nThis works because unlike APPS on a PHONE, being healthy is not separate things like your body, or your mind, or your food.\nEverything is connected. The secret to understanding health is to realize that everything is connected. What you eat has an effect on how you feel. And how you feel affects your motivation to workout. Working out affects your mood which affects your friendships.\nIt’s a lot to take in, but I think you’re already part way there.\nThe Mental Health Examples §\nWe’re living through a mental health revolution.\nTake for example mental health. May people today understand that mental health is an important part of our wellbeing.\nWays to improve mental health §\nLook at this list\nIt’s different strategies to improve mental health\nBut they’re not just focused on the brain or the mind\nThey’re focused on different aspects of your life.\nIf you care about mental health, then you’re already on your way to understanding health very well.\nYou already understand, that to take care of your mental health, you work on every aspect of your life.\nYou can work on your mental health directly, but you can also work on it by exploring other aspects also.\nSame Idea expanded. Everything in your experience is connected §\nTake that idea from mental health, and blow that up, and you have this concept called deep health.\nThe truth is, all things in your experience are connected. Your body is connected to your mind. And also your body is connected to your relationships, and to your environment. That is the main idea for today. What makes you healthy is not just what you do in the gym. Or what you eat on your plate.\nHow much time you spend with people that care about you and support you makes you healthy. Having a connection with something larger than yourself is part of health. The city or place you live in is part of you’re health.\nSo when I say, I want to be healthy. I usually mean, I want to exercise more, and I want to eat better food. But it should also mean, that I want to cultivate supportive relationships, and I want to live in an environment that’s good for me.\nEverything goes well at the same time\nEverything goes wrong at the same time\nExample §\nLook at this example. Michael sleeps late, and he doesn’t get a good night’s sleep. He wakes up and feels cranky. Because of that, he’s mean to his friends. Sarcastic and sassy. Then he works out, he’s more likely to get injured.\nOn the other hand\nYou eat a good meal before your exam.\nAnd you’re able to perform well.\nIf you relax.\nyou don’t have indigestion.\nThis is what is called Deep Health §\n(Show the deep health diagram)\nWhat I’ve just described above is what I like to call Deep Health. It’s an idea that I borrowed from other health coaches and some counselors.\nDeep health is another way of saying that being healthy is more than being physically fit. Deep health covers all dimensions of your life, including physical fitness. And if you want to be healthy for a long time, you can try to approach it from a deep health perspective.\nWhat health researchers know is this:\n\nEverything in our lives are connected.\nIf you are thriving in one area, then other areas of your life will get “propped up”\n\nFor example, if you get a good night’s sleep (physical), you’re more likely to do well in an exam or presentation (mental), you’re also more patient and kind to people around you (relational)\n\n\nConversely, if one area is struggling, other areas can be affected as well\n\nFor example, if someone is judgemental or unsupportive of your goals (relational), it might affect your eating habits, and sleep (physical). It may even make you doubt yourself deeply (existential)\n\n\n\nAnswer the survey §\nThe Value of a Life Dashboard\nhttps://www.precisionnutrition.com/deep-health\nHere’s another footnote\nI hope you have a basic understanding of deep health now. The next step is to go over each area, and try to understand- what areas am I doing well in? What areas come naturally to me? Where do I have inherent strengths? Where do I have inherent weaknesses?\nThis will give you some idea of how to design your health pratices well.\nGoing over each area §\nGetting a “Deep health” snapshot\n(at this point, I’ll ask them to draw the diagram, and we’ll fill it up togehter)\nPhysical Health §\nPhysical health is what everyone thinks of when they think of being healthy.\nThat’s exercise and diet.\nAsk yourself here,\n\nHow do you feel about your exercise and movement right now?\nAnd how do you feel about the food that you’re eating right now?\n\nScore yourself higher here if:\nScore yourself lower her if:\nDo you have the physical freedom to do the things you want to do? Or is something holding you back? Like a bad back, or rickety knees?\nIf you’re happy with your physical health, the way you move and eat, then give yourself a higher score here. If you’d like to improve things, you can place yourself where you think you are.\nEmotional Health §\nEmotional health focuses on the question: How well can I handle my emotions? Am I able to express my emotions appropriately?\nScore yourself higher here if: §\nScore yourself lower here if: §\nThese days, how is your emotional health?\nMental Health §\nMental health over here is different from the mental health we talked about above. Here, the question to answer is, “Does my brain feel engaged by the things I am doing in my day?”\nScore yourself higher if:\n\nThese days, I feel really engaged with my work and hobbies.\nI like the problems that I’m encountering now. I like trying to solve them\nI feel stimulated during my day.\n\nScore yourself lower if:\n\nThese days I feel quite bored and uninterested\nI feel like I’m mostly doing things mindlessly\nI can’t even remember how I spent my day\n\nExistential Health §\nExistential Health talks about your sense of purpose. Do you have a goal and clear motivation for yourself. Do you know why you do the things you do?\nScore yourself higher here if:\n\nI feel like I’m building towards my future\nI can imagine\n\nScore yourself lower here if:\n\nI feel like I’m stuck\n\nRelational Health §\nRelational Health has to do with the people around you. Are you supported by close friends and relatives? Do you have people in your life that can help you with your goals?\nScore yourself high\n\nYou have someone you can talk to when you’re in distress\n\nScore yourself low if:\n\nYou feel more disconnected and isolated\nYou feel like you’re struggling alone\n\nWhat do you need from your loved ones in order to help you work on your health\nEnvironmental Health §\nEnvironmental Health has to do with the space you find yourself in. This can be many things. Are you surrounded by green and life where you live? Are you happy with your home? Your city?\nScore yourself higher here if:\n\nYour environment makes it easier for you to be health\n\nScore yourself lower here if:\n\nYou feel unsafe or insecure with where you live\nYou feel restricted by factors that are outside of your control.\n\nIs there any way to change your environment, to help you meet your goals?\nBreakout rooms will go here. §\n(How is this going to happen)\nBringing it back and getting ideas in §\nIs it Overwhelming or Empowering? §\nThe challenge is that problems are connected.\nThe good news is that solutions are connected too!\nFocus on your strengths!\nDon’t force yourself, “trick” yourself.\nRelational is strong for you?\nInstead of forcing yourself to exercise or eat well\nRecruit some friends to do it with you.\nMental is strong for you?\nInstead of forcing yourself to exercise\nWhy don’t you do some research- Study and see what you learn. This may motivate you more\n(I have booklists)\nKey takeaway for me here:\nBut the perspective I like to take is that there are many things you can do! If you can’t exercise right now, because it’s the pandemic, that’s okay. You can spend time with family- and you’re still taking care of your health by doing that.\nPull your health by focusing on different things.\nKey Idea 2: It looks different for every person §\nAnalogy §\nWho’s the healthiest here\nBodybuilder-\nFather who spends time with their kids\nStudent who hangs out with friends, volunteers at a hospital.\n—\nThe fish swim thing from Einstein\nthe image of the test?\nSomething that talks about best fit.\nIdea §\nDeep health looks different for each of us. What it means for you to be healthy is very different than what it means for me to be healthy.\nThe best example that we’re all familiar with here is the different between introverts and extroverts. An introvert will spend their night chatting with a friend online, and they can feel that their relational score for deep health is good. But for an extrovert, that might not be enough. So they would score themselves lower in that situation.\nBut for some people. It makes them self conscious. They feel awkward. They can’t focus on their movements.\nSo for different people, the social support for them to be healthy looks different.\nBut this is true for all dimensions!\nMaybe for physical exercise- you like to go on long runs. And that’s really motivating for you. But another person like to swim. Someone else likes yoga.\nThere’s no one best workout. There’s just the best workout for you.\nKey Idea 3: Try running mini-deep-health experiments. §\nAnalogy §\nI’m going to go to the gym everyday FOR THE WHOLE YEAR\nExploring and being surprised\nThe best travel stories\nCISV - You don’t know what to expect\nIdea §\nBecuase different things work for different people, you’re going to have to try out things for yourself. And to make it much less overwhelming, I found that doing small mini experiments through the year are much better to learn.\n\n\nConsider your deep health\n\n\nThink about what you’d like to work on\n\n\nI follow this template\n\n\nFor the next 10 days, I’m going to work on ((pick an area)) by trying to ((pick an activity)). ((Pick a person)) is going to help me by ((some specific way))\nTwo weeks later:\nAfter trying to ((activity)) for two weeks, I noticed that ((What worked well)). I also noticed that I struggled with ((what was difficult)). If I do this again I would consider ((some alternatives))\n—\n10 days, so that it’s not such a big commitment."},"Notes/Deep-Health-and-all-the-factors":{"title":"Deep Health and all the factors","links":[],"tags":["-holistic-health-factors-on/deep-why-deep-health"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nOn Being with Krista Tippett\nKimberley Wilson — Whole Body Mental Health\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/6299cc37e6f4a6f5a94aa92b\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nHow much of your stress or health is\nhow much sleep you’re getting\nOr what you’re eating?\nHow can we make little improvements\nHow much is relationships?\nHow much is your trauma?\nSee also §"},"Notes/Defining-a-habit":{"title":"Defining a habit","links":["Maps/Habits-MOC","tags/habit","Notes/Feedback-Loop","Notes/Habits-carry-a-ton-of-hidden-inertia","Notes/Changing-a-habit-is-really-about-replacing-a-routine"],"tags":["habit"],"content":"up:: Habits MOC\ntags::#habit\nDefining a habit §\nA habit is a mirror, it gives what you give it—and what you were given is what you’ll give.

The freedom to step away from the daily grind, to rediscover forgotten hobbies or explore new landscapes, is alluring. But it’s not just a simple pause; it’s a complex interplay of emotional and practical considerations.\nThe emotional hurdles are real and varied: anxiety about future employment, shame for needing a break, guilt for wanting one, and even the fear that the freedom might be too seductive. These feelings aren’t just fleeting thoughts; they’re deeply ingrained narratives that can hold us back. It’s like standing on the edge of a cliff, paralyzed by the dizzying array of “what-ifs.”\nOn the flip side, the practicalities can’t be ignored. Financial stability is a big one. If you’re building a business that’s not yet profitable, the idea of taking time off might seem ludicrous. But here’s a counterintuitive thought: What if the sabbatical is what you need to recharge and come back with a fresh perspective that could turn your business around?\nThe key is to plan meticulously.

A prevailing notion is that doctors tend to avoid aggressive treatments when facing terminal illness, opting for palliative care that focuses more on comfort and quality of life. This is backed by data indicating that hospice care may, counterintuitively, extend life compared to aggressive interventions.\nHowever, it’s crucial to recognize that this narrative isn’t a one-size-fits-all. Some doctors do fight tooth and nail, perhaps propelled by their deep-rooted knowledge or even ego. Others find a middle ground, taking a personalized journey that intertwines medical rationality with personal spirituality. Thus, while access to comprehensive information is a potent tool, it is not the sole compass guiding one’s choices at the end of life.\nInstead, perhaps the most impactful “treatment” comes from within—aligning one’s spirituality with the hard, often uncomfortable facts at hand. This is akin to blending two opposing forces: the rigidity of medical evidence and the fluidity of spiritual belief. The convergence of these elements could be seen as the health sector’s equivalent of jazz improvisation—improvising a tune on the fly, even as you read from a well-known musical score.\nSo, does the medical community’s approach to end-of-life care reflect universal wisdom or is it a form of professional bias? The answer likely lies in the individual’s personal and spiritual domain, transcending what can be captured by clinical studies or professional consensus. Making a final decision involves a personal “alchemy” that balances the known with the unknown, the physical with the spiritual.\nAnd as in any alchemical process, the end result is both transformative and deeply personal—a life choice uniquely your own.\n\nRead more at: How Doctors Die | Essay | Zócalo Public Square\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: What happens if we never die"},"Notes/Dometic-mini-freezer":{"title":"Dometic mini freezer","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dometic mini freezer §\nOverland pros"},"Notes/Don-Bosco":{"title":"Don Bosco","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Saint Don Bosco was an Italian Roman Catholic priest who dedicated his life to the education and care of disadvantaged youth in the 19th century. He is known for his innovative teaching methods and his strong belief in the value of practical, hands-on learning.\nBorn in 1815 in Turin, Italy, Don Bosco was the youngest of three children. He grew up in poverty and experienced the struggles of being a disadvantaged youth firsthand. Despite these challenges, he excelled in his studies and was eventually ordained as a priest in 1841.\nAfter his ordination, Don Bosco began working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. He quickly realized that traditional methods of education were not effective for these boys, who were often uninterested in academics and more interested in practical skills. In response, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture.\nDon Bosco’s innovative methods proved to be highly successful, and he quickly gained a reputation as a compassionate and effective educator. He also founded the Salesian Society, a group of priests and laypeople dedicated to the education and care of disadvantaged youth. The Salesian Society still exists today and has spread to countries all over the world.\nIn addition to his work with disadvantaged youth, Don Bosco was also a strong advocate for the rights of workers and was deeply involved in the labor movement of his time. He believed that education and work were key components of a fulfilling and meaningful life, and he worked tirelessly to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they needed to succeed.\nDon Bosco was beatified in 1929 and canonized as a saint in 1934. Today, he is remembered as a pioneer in education and a model of compassion and service. His legacy lives on through the work of the Salesian Society and the many people whose lives have been touched by his teachings.\n—\nOne well-known anecdote from the life of Saint Don Bosco involves a dream he had when he was a young boy. In the dream, he saw a group of boys who were lost and in danger. He tried to lead them to safety, but they kept running away from him.\nAs he chased after the boys, he was joined by a tall, handsome man who told him, “Don’t be afraid. Take these boys under your protection. Educate them, and I will help you.”\nWhen Don Bosco woke up from the dream, he was deeply moved by it and felt called to dedicate his life to the education and care of disadvantaged youth. He saw the dream as a sign from God and took it as a mission to help young people who were lost and in need of guidance.\nThis dream had a profound impact on Don Bosco’s life and shaped the course of his career as an educator. He worked tirelessly to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they needed to succeed, and his innovative teaching methods helped countless boys to achieve their potential.\n—\nOne more anecdote from the life of Saint Don Bosco involves a time when he was working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. There was a young boy named Tony who was particularly difficult to reach and seemed resistant to all of Don Bosco’s efforts to help him.\nDespite this, Don Bosco refused to give up on Tony and continued to try to reach out to him. He eventually discovered that Tony was struggling with a learning disability that made it difficult for him to keep up in school.\nRather than giving up on Tony, Don Bosco worked with him individually and found creative ways to help him learn. He used hands-on activities and practical exercises to engage Tony and help him understand the material.\nThrough his persistence and patience, Don Bosco was able to help Tony overcome his learning disability and succeed in school. This experience was just one example of the compassionate and innovative approach that Don Bosco brought to his work with disadvantaged youth.\n—\nAfter his ordination, Don Bosco began working with disadvantaged youth in the streets of Turin. He quickly realized that traditional methods of education were not effective for these boys, who were often uninterested in academics and more interested in practical skills. In response, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture.\nRather than giving up on Tony, Don Bosco worked with him individually and found creative ways to help him learn. He used hands-on activities and practical exercises to engage Tony and help him understand the material.\n—\nUse your hands\nWhat activity did you take up during the pandemic years?\nWas it baking? Gardening? Knitting?\nDid you learn a new instrument? Start working out? Or take up cooking?\nPersonally I picked up woodworking. It was so satisfying to cut and carve wood. Assemble it together and polish it into a finished product.\nMost of the activities that people sought during the pandemic had to do with ‘using your hands.’ We all found solace in physically making something, even from scratch.\n200 years ago, Don Bosco already knew that was true.\nHe’s among the famous saints in the Catholic tradition. Well known for being a teacher, and all the schools he inspired. During his life, he focused on the disadvantaged youth in Turin. He saw that for these troubled children, the usual way of teaching them was not working.\nSo he didn’t force it.\nInstead, he developed a new approach to education that focused on hands-on learning and included activities such as carpentry, printing, and agriculture. (Yep! Getting people to use their hands for work) That helped those struggling youth find work- but spiritually it also helped them relax, and calm down (just like it did for us in the last 3 years)\nHere in the Philippines, this is what we associate Don Bosco with- all the vocational schools and technical skills that a Don Bosco education provided.\nBut I also think we make a big mistake when we think of “Don Bosco”, “Disadvantaged Youth”, “Vocational Training”, and we immediately think “Oh that’s not me.”\nYes, you may not be a disadvantaged youth. Yes, you probably don’t do any vocational work.\nBut just for a minute, exercise your spiritual imagination a little.\nAren’t you disadvantaged, struggling, and troubled?\nI know I am.\nTechnology, media, the news fills me with anxiety\nDo you need to do some manual work?\nI know I do.\nI’m always thinking, thinking, thinking.\nBut when I use my hands and garden, I focus on where I am in that moment. Nothing but what I see and the sensations of my work.\nWork that uses my hands.\nOne of my favorite teaching from John Paul II is about work itself. He says:\n“Since work is always a personal action it follows that the whole person, body and spirit, participates in it, no matter what kind of work it is.”\nWe glamorize the preaching of Jesus, but we forget that he was also a carpenter. Someone who worked with your hands. And anyone who has made anything with their hands will tell you- that the process of creating something. Not rushing. Taking your time. Making mistakes. Learning. This has a holiness all of its own.\nJesus knew this. Don Bosco knew this.

Later, it became a tool for changing my body into something deemed better than the body I had, and that’s when rules came in, assigning moral value to different kinds of foods, calories were obsessively counted, and I got further and further away from connection to my own hunger and full cues and intuitive cravings.\nTo me, a major theme of my last book was that sometimes things that cause short-term boosts can undermine long-term development. But — human intuition being what it is — it’s hard to internalize the idea of a short/long-term tradeoff.\nThat’s interesting because what looks like elite performance is not healthy.\nOr rather what we imagine health to be is the elite performance variety. But there are so many quality of life tradeoffs that are being made when someone wants to be elite in that way.\nThat reminds me of Post Athlete life almost always reverts to mean\nIt’s similar because I remember when I was an athlete, I felt like I was just going to perform and be healthy forever and ever. But of course that’s not true. It’s so hard to imagine in the moment that it isn’t going to last forever, even though you know that conceptually.\nIt’s different because I was never as elite as Lauren Fleshman. Because I didn’t make all the sacrficies. Maybe intuitively I already knew what the tradeoffs were and didn’t want to go there.\nIt’s important because if someone wants to be healthy today, there’s way more that goes into that than just being elite.

It’s akin to a shadow that follows you, regardless of how much light you shine on your work. The key isn’t to eliminate the fear but to get comfortable with it, to make it a part of your creative DNA.\nConsider the journey from a handful of views to millions. The emotional landscape doesn’t shift as dramatically as the numbers do. You might think hitting a milestone will vanquish your fears, but in reality, the fear remains. It’s not about the numbers; it’s about the act of creating itself.\nHere’s a question I often ponder: What’s worse, the fear of creating something that no one sees or the fear of not creating at all? The latter is a silent killer, eroding your potential day by day.\nThis is why practice is non-negotiable. It’s like hiking a trail you’ve never been on before. The first time, every rustle in the bushes makes you jump. But as you walk it again and again, you become familiar with the sounds, the terrain, and even your own internal rhythms of fear and excitement. You never stop being cautious, but you do stop being paralyzed.\nRemember, if you’re not creating because you’re scared, you’re not getting used to the fear. You’re letting it win. So, the next time fear whispers in your ear, acknowledge it, thank it for its concern, and then proceed to do the work anyway. Because the work is where you grow, and growth is where you find your freedom.\nThis matters to me because I’ve felt the weight of this fear, and I know I’m not alone. Even seasoned professionals feel it. The difference is, they’ve made peace with it. And so can I, through consistent practice.\n\nRead more at: How to Get Over the Fear of Creating Things\nGo one level up : Creator Economy MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Writing helps you be creative"},"Notes/Embracing-the-Art-of-\"Showing-Up\"-in-the-World-of-Entrepreneurship":{"title":"Embracing the Art of \"Showing Up\" in the World of Entrepreneurship","links":["Maps/Entrepreneurship-MOC","Notes/The-High-Income-Skills-Symphony-in-Modern-Entrepreneurship"],"tags":["entrepreneurship","finance","resilience","opportunities"],"content":"In the world of entrepreneurship, one valuable strategy stands out—a relentless commitment to “showing up.” This slow grind approach is not about instant results but a steady accumulation of effort, akin to a marathon rather than a sprint.\nAs an entrepreneur, the transition away from the security of a bi-monthly paycheck can be nerve-wracking. The volatility of net worth in this new landscape is undeniable. Surprisingly, even during the highs and lows of financial life, the worry about money remains a constant companion. It becomes clear that financial anxiety is often independent of the actual balance in one’s bank account once basic needs are met.\nDespite the hardships, there’s an essential truth to grasp here. If you consistently show up, deliver value, exhibit decency, and apply your intellect, opportunities have a way of gravitating towards you. It’s not an immediate solution but a path that demands resilience and unwavering commitment.\nThe journey may be tough and stressful, but it’s in the persistence and continuous presence that the seeds of success are sown.\n\nRead more at: Life after “Golden Handcuffs” | RadReads\nGo one level up : Entrepreneurship MOC\nYou may also be interested in: The High-Income Skills Symphony in Modern Entrepreneurship"},"Notes/Emergence-(defn)":{"title":"Emergence (defn)","links":["Notes/Idea-Emergence-(defn)","tags/on/systems"],"tags":["on/systems"],"content":"up:: Idea Emergence (defn)\ntags::#on/systems\nEmergence (defn) §\nEmergence refers to the existence or formation of collective behaviors — what parts of a system do together that they would not do alone.\nTo quickly understand this amazing concept, I try to dumb it down and say “Emergence is adding complexity.” Or “Emergence is when the new whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”\nIf I was alone in a room, but now I am talking with friends, we are at a higher level of complexity.\n\nMe alone equals Emergence Level 1\nMe with friends equals Emergence Level 2\n"},"Notes/Emergency-reserves-lets-you-push":{"title":"Emergency reserves lets you push","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Emergency reserves lets you push §\nBetter than an easy goal\nTo me this means you have some extra energy in case things get tough\nOr you want to give yourself a little bit more"},"Notes/Emerson-Creative-Spark-and-Oversoul-and-Inculturation":{"title":"Emerson Creative Spark and Oversoul and Inculturation","links":["tags/idea-note","tags/on/creativity","tags/on/creation","tags/on/nature","tags/inculturation"],"tags":["idea-note","on/creativity","on/creation","on/nature","inculturation"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note#on/creativity#on/creation#on/nature#inculturation\nurl: https://www.airr.io/quote/627b0efb1239922546f6bf09\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nIdeas that you start to form when you get in touch with nature\nThe differences come from the creative spark\nand interacts with different circumstances\nAccounts for apparent differences\nSee also §"},"Notes/Emil-Zatopek-and-his-breath-holding-technique-(example)":{"title":"Emil Zatopek and his breath holding technique (example)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Emil Zatopek and his breath holding technique (example) §\nSource: §\n\n??\n\nKey ideas §\n\n\nI remember reading about Zatopek, and his insane (triple?)\n\nHe won the 5k, the 10k, and the marathon\n\n\n\nIn the 2021 Olympics Safan has done something similar\n\nShe won the 5k and 10k; and the bronzed in the 1500m\n\n\n"},"Notes/Emotional-intelligence-has-more-to-do-with-trusting-our-gut":{"title":"Emotional intelligence has more to do with trusting our gut","links":["Notes/Self-1-and-Self-2-(concept)"],"tags":[],"content":"Emotional intelligence has more to do with trusting our gut §\nSo a bit of a myth about how in touch with your emotions you are.\nSelf 2 in\nSelf 1 and Self 2 (concept)\nNon verbal\nThey are aware\nIn touch with their internal states\nCan articulate them\nJohn Mayer and Peter Salovey\n1990 paper\nhttps://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.2190/DUGG-P24E-52WK-6CDG"},"Notes/Empathetic-Response":{"title":"Empathetic Response","links":["Notes/Deploy-Empathy-+-Kevon's-Be-a-Dummy"],"tags":["-on/empathy-script-"],"content":"Idea Name §\nContext / Source §\nDeploy Empathy\nMichele Hansen\nurl: https://readwise.io/bookreview/16925964\nTweet url:\nKey Idea §\nA sample empathetic response\nAn empathetic response would have been “It sounds like you’re having a hard time,” which makes the person feel heard.\nSee also §\nDeploy Empathy + Kevon’s Be a Dummy"},"Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)":{"title":"Energy (re Flow)","links":["Notes/FlowCreation-MOC","tags/flow","Notes/Direction-(re-Flow)","Poor-Diet","Notes/Energy-(re-Flow)","Notes/Enthusiasm-(re-Flow)"],"tags":["flow"],"content":"up:: FlowCreation MOC\ntags::#flow\nAttention is what the mind is focused on—and what it has been focused on over the recent past (the past 72 hours is simple way to look at it).

O2 levels increase. CO2 levels decrease. pH levels increase (and surprisingly stay higher than what’s normal even after breath-holding, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe they are associated with pH drops.\nO2:CO2 Ratio &amp; pH Levels:\n\nA normal ratio is 4:1 &amp; pH: 7.40\nDuring hyperventilation, the ratio goes up to 11:1 &amp; pH: 7.70\nDuring hypoventilation, the ratio goes down to 1:1 &amp; pH: 7.50\n\nInteresting note: Even after breath-holding, pH levels stay surprisingly higher than normal, which should negate a lot of the breath-holding worries, since I believe the detriments that are talked about are always associated with drops in pH. Hence, if pH stays above normal, all should be good. I’d love to get some expert opinions on this.\n\nResearch Link\n\nLactate Levels:\n\nA normal range is 0.5 - 1.5 mmol/L. The test subject’s baseline was 0.70.\nDuring hyperventilation, it only increased to 1.15 mmol/L.\nDuring hypoventilation, it lowered to 0.90 mmol/L.\n\nFor comparison a 15-45 second sprint shows lactate levels rising way up to 8-15 mmol/L. So, there is no worry for the minuscule rise in lactate levels from hyper-hypoventilation.\n\nResearch Link\n\nBenefit # 1: POSITIVE HORMONAL RESPONSE AND A (SUPPOSED) INCREASED IMMUNE SYSTEM. §\nThis act stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline (just like taking a cold shower, which also forces us to hyperventilate a bit), and has been shown to benefit the immune system.\nBenefit # 2: MINDFULNESS §\nBoth conscious “over-breathing” and the conscious breath-holding act as a fast and simple form of mindfulness for me, getting me out of racing thoughts in the prefrontal cortex, and—due to the hormonal release—allowing my brain stem and more primitive parts of the brain (such as the pituitary gland) to activate without invoking worry and stress (I admit things get unclear for me here, so I’d like to hear more on this). Regardless, I’m more calm, centered, and clear-minded afterwards.\nBenefit # 3: EUPHORIC FEELING §\nBreathing in excess O2 leads to tingling fingers and lightheadedness. It also creates a slightly euphoric feeling. Is that weird?\nPART 2 §\nThen after elevating my O2 levels, that’s when I hold my breath, which I imagine completely moves the O2:CO2 ratio in the opposite relationship — like a seesaw. And in the process, it leads to:\nBenefit # 4: WILLPOWER BOOST §\nIt gives a sense of control. And my belief is that a SENSE of control is a main factor in willpower and happiness. (Whether or not we really have any real control is a separate debate.) Since this odd activity increases my sense of control, it increases my sense of happiness.\nBenefit # 5: ANTI-FRAGILITY §\nStressing the mind and body (safely) leads to the overcompensation effect. That’s why we adapt to heavy weights by getting stronger (to throw out a common example).\nMajor Concern §\nDoes this pattern of Hyperventilation/Retention cause any harm? There are a few studies covering Wim Hof and his method that show clear results (see below), but much more research is needed.\nAnybody have other takes, insights, research, commentary, or suggestions on this?\nResearch Link : http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full\n\nNote on Lactate Levels\nLactic acid is a product of cell metabolism that can accumulate when cells lack sufficient oxygen (hypoxia) and must turn to a less efficient means of energy production, or when a condition causes excess production or impaired clearance of lactate.\nDepending on pH, it is sometimes present in the form of lactic acid. However, with the neutral pH maintained by the body, most lactic acid will be present in the blood as lactate.\n\n\nBack Matter\n\ndates:: 2015-12-03\n\n\n\n"},"Notes/Expose-and-adapt-vs-Correct-and-Protect":{"title":" Expose and adapt vs Correct and Protect ","links":["Notes/Antifragility","Maps/Health-MOC","Notes/How-to-be-more-confident-in-your-injury-recovery--and-why-being-confident-makes-a-big-difference"],"tags":["-expose-","-injury-","-recovery-","-adapting-"],"content":"I like this idea,\nI’ve been applying it to my own training\nit’s contrasted with correct and protect\nSomething that’s stronger once it’s been broken\nLink this to Antifragility\nWhat is it? §\nThat if you want to deal with pain, one strategy is to expose yourself to some new movements.\nThis way your body doesn’t have any fear associated with moving.\nThe body can adapt to many things.\nYou can trust your own body to get better.\nWhy is it important? §\nBecause we’re always dealing with pain in one way shape or form.\nAt least here, it means you don’t have to just hide\n\nRead more at: Podcast With Greg Lehman — BETTER MOVEMENT\nGo one level up : Health MOC\nYou may also be interested in: How to be more confident in your injury recovery- and why being confident makes a big difference"},"Notes/External-cues-vs-Internal-cues":{"title":"External cues vs Internal cues","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"External cues vs Internal cues §\nIt’s generally accepted that external cues work better than internal cues\ntry to find external cues\nBecause you can’t really describe what is in the body so well?\nIsrael Halperin\nBetter movement podcast"},"Notes/External-vs-Internal-Attentional-Focus":{"title":"External vs Internal Attentional Focus","links":["Inner-Game-of-Tennis","Self-2","Visualizing-an-Outcome","Motor-Control-and-Learning:-A-Behavioral-Emphasis","Gabriele-Wulf"],"tags":[],"content":"Internal Focus and External Focus §\nContext §\nThis is about learning and how to develop new skills\nWhat is it §\nInternal focus\n\nYou focus on your own body.

It might seem like these situations only arise in rare, crucial moments. But Phil Knight’s choice to face his fear is just a larger-than life version of a choice you make all the time.\nNote: What am I afraid of, and what am I avoiding? What causes me fear and anxiety? Can I practice facing that properly?\nThe practice of exposure follows from what we already know about fear: the best way to get over fear is to face it. But it turns out that not all exposure is created equal—there are ways to effectively optimize your exposure so that you can maximize your chances for actually reducing your fear and making sure it doesn’t come back.\nNote: Keep exposing yourself to scary situations- but do it in an optimal, planned out, and reflective way.\nRather than aiming for fear reduction, exposures should aim for surprise.\nNote: This is counterintuitive and powerful. Instead of being outcome based, practice being open to surprises!\nIn my experience, it’s that willingness that makes the key difference. When I’m truly willing to feel the emotion, whatever was troubling me feels a little bit less imminent, and a little bit less sticky than it did before—and I’m able to move through it more fluidly.\nNote: This is general advice on how to approach an exposure experience.\n\nRead more at: Fear, Courage, and Willingness - Superorganizers - Every\nGo one level up : Health Mindsets MOC\nYou may also be interested in: Change is Hard, don’t pretend it isn’t"},"Notes/Fail-fast-and-fail-forward":{"title":"Fail fast and fail forward","links":["Failure-is-an-option!-Designing-your-fitness-life-(Blog-Post)"],"tags":[],"content":"Fail fast and fail forward §\nFailure is an option!

healthy.\nWe put all our money and investment on remedies\n(hospitals, medicine)\nand not enough on prevention and healthy lifestyles\nBut arguably that’s a bigger part of healthcare than the medicine and the hospitalization.\nIn a sense you wouldn’t be needing that latter bit as much if you had a stronger system of healthcare in place\nCan you imagine getting a gym membership from your health insurance?\nOr living and working in a place where they provide dental, ER, but also gym allocation?\nSome kind of system where you’re properly incentivized to work on your health in a simple

checks you up.\nThey see that you’re spine is slightly out of alignment\nThey can give you some medicine to help you with the pain now.\nBut they don’t want to recommend surgery because it’s not absolutely necessary.\nSo they say, you should consider doing the following exercises:\n\nsome stretching\nsome weights\netc\n\nAnd then they set you off.\nNow what?\nYou’re kinda stuck.\nIf they have a partnered facility.\nThen you can do some physical therapy there.\nAnd that will help give you some ideas\nBut at some point you get stuck\nBecause the system dropped out\nSo a fitness coach\n(apart from being a motivator)\nWill help you set up a system\nSo that you can continue to do things\neven when the circumstances change na.\nJames Clear Quote\nWe fall to the level of our systems\nWhy is this important §\nBecause we’re starting to understand more the importance of systemic health\nNot one time interventions\nThe Place of medicine and breathing (Quote)\nThere’s the one time big time

However he came about plotting the two variables against each, it’s a landmark discovery. It’s a lodestar to which I keep returning. It’s the foundation much of my thinking and to my carving of that theory to practical, moment-to-moment application.\n\nLater on, Dr. Mihaly used this version to show the different states of mind plotted on the map of Challenge vs Skill.\n\nWhat is my Contribution to Flow Theory? §\nMy contribution to Flow Theory is just to expand on using the Flow Map as a practical tool to adjust one’s state of mind as needed—usually to create the Conditions of Flow (FlowCreation Theory).\nBasically, Mihaly’s Flow Map can be used many times a day as a simple tool to identify one’s current state of mind. That’s the easy part.\nThe second part is all about how to take that knowledge to improve one’s state of mind—ideally by getting closer to a feeling of a high quality experience—what Mihaly calls “optimal experience,” which is none other than Flow.\nSo you can use the Flow Map as a “State of Mind” Map—a useful guide to manage your state of mind from moment to moment.\n\nFind your current state of mind—Maybe ask, “What am I feeling?” or “Where’s my head at?”\nCreate the Conditions of Flow—This is where we can develop some FlowCreation Theory skills and tactics.\n\nSay, someone is anxious: they can point to “Anxiety” on the Flow Map and then have a few ideas how to get closer to “Optimal Experience” (Flow).

Here is an example of each:\n\n“I’m Anxious, I’m feeling confused.” Do I know what to focus on right now? Am I doing the thing I should be doing right now? If this is the issue, then my Direction isn’t solid. How can I improve my clarity about what to do? How can I reduce the amount of competing actions to take?\n“I’m Anxious, my mind is scattered.” What’s my environment like; am I getting interrupted too much? If so, then my Attention is suffering. How can I reduce the intensity and frequency of these distractions?\n“I’m not excited about anything, I’m apathetic.” I need to reconnect to some Enthusiasm. What gets me excited or motivated? How can I reconnect with that?\n“I’m tired, I have a headache, everything feels like too much.” Why are my Energy levels down? What needs to be improved out of the following: quality of sleep, diet, exercise, leisure time, and/or relationships?\n\nFour Factors of Flow §\nI have found that using the Flow Map to find your current State of Mind is a valuable exercise to improving it. Equally valuable is using it to find any glaring weaknesses in the elements that help create a good State of Mind. I have found that there are essentially Four Factors of Flow. They are: Direction (re Flow), Attention (re Flow), Enthusiasm (re Flow), and Energy (re Flow). The best way to improve your experience is to identify what you’re lacking, and then taking actions to strengthen that area."},"Notes/Flowers-leaves-or-roots-(Blog-Draft)":{"title":"Flowers leaves or roots (Blog Draft)","links":["Notes/The-timing-of-festivals-and-dictating-seasons","How-plants-direct-their-energy"],"tags":[],"content":"Flowers, leaves, or roots (Blog Draft) §\nSource §\n\n??\nAs a note, I can’t find single sources for a lot of the homesteading things\n\nKey Idea §\nWhen growing plants you have to choose among these things\nWhen we got our new calamansi plant, it was already starting to have a few fruits on it.

When we talk about fluid frameworks in the “Linking Your Thinking” System, we’re mainly referring to higher-order notes like MOCs and the Home note (but a balanced use of MOCs, folders, tags, and queries can also maintain a fluid structure).\nFluid frameworks are not mutually exclusive. That means a note with its link in an MOC, doesn’t exclusively live in the MOC note. A note can live and link freely. A note can be discovered in as many places as it’s referenced. These are the fundamentals of linking notes together.\nNow with higher-order notes like MOCs, we can fluidly add any structure, at any time. But these frameworks offer unique attributes to allow us to work more fluidly than ever before.\nFluid Frameworks vs Rigid Frameworks §\nWow…So a fluid framework is a non-essential supporting structure.\nWhereas, a typical framework—like a folder—is an essential supporting structure. Delete the folder, and you delete the files within.\nAnd that’s because folders are not fluid; they are a rigid framework. They reduce the number of ways you have to access the notes trapped within. Now it’s worth noting, we do have Global Search, and we can link to notes within folders…so that’s better than it used to be…but there is still no removing the friction that comes from having to twirl down folders X, Y, and Z, just to get to Idea Omega.)\nSo even though folders alone are rigid, if you expertly use Fluid Frameworks—i.e. HIGHER-ORDER NOTES—to support your linked knowledge, then you can also work back in some smart applications of folders.\nThat’s why we’re here: to become skilled and confident with how we are deploying the tools that we have to structure our notes in the best way possible.\n\n\nSee the inspiration for using the term “fluid” at Fluid Taxonomies.\nFor more see: Benefits of LYT frameworks\n"},"Notes/Fluid-Taxonomies":{"title":"Fluid Taxonomies","links":["Notes/LYT-Kit","tags/pkm","Steen-Comer","tags/source/quote","Notes/Fluid-Frameworks"],"tags":["pkm","source/quote"],"content":"up:: LYT Kit\ntags::#pkm\n\n\n                  \n                  Notes on this note \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nThis is a sanitized version of my actual note.\n\nSome content and links have been removed.\n\n\nFluid Taxonomies §\nFluid Taxonomies is a term coined by Steen Comer, which came up in our conversations about MOCs and other ways of managing knowledge.\nSteen wrote:\n\nFluid Taxonomies\nThe notion that in a loosely-ordered system like a ZK, you can apply taxonomies in an on again, off again way, and not be beholden to any of them for longer than they are useful.\n\n[These taxonomies] are useful abstractions, ways of arranging information to provide paths for specific purposes.\nAll of them have advantages and disadvantages. Most notably, all of them fail to give you the serendipity of search that most [zettlekasten] options traditionally have. Which is fine, depending on what you’re trying to do.\nMake sure you keep in mind that whatever taxonomy you’re using is not True, it’s just a tool.\nIt occurs to me, another way of thinking about this is that you’re applying hierarchies, like a file system directory tree, but they’re being applied in such a way that does not limit the data to staying in those hierarchies.\n[Consider] the metaphor of a functioning collective. You put a hierarchy in place (like an MOC), for as long as it’s useful. And then when it’s not useful, the members of that hierarchy rearrange their power structure to suit the new purpose.\nThen to summarize the conversation, Steen riffed on the Discordian quote:\n\n“All models are True in some sense, False in some sense, and Meaningless in some sense”#source/quote\n\nSteen is one of those people who makes you think.

(As we talked about last time)\nBut one thing that injury does give is the chance to ask a very important question to yourself:\nAnd that question is “Why would I care to get back into action?” \nIt sounds like an obvious question- but diving into it may reveal something to you. It can help you understand your mindset when it comes to injury, recovery, and what you value.\n“Why does movement matter to you?”\nMaybe you love the way it makes you feel. The way it boosts your energy levels, or the way it helped you stay fit and healthy. \nMaybe you love the goal setting. You love performing well and hitting your targets. You love reaching new heights.\nMaybe it matters for you to stay healthy for your family. Or the people in your life who rely on you.\nIf you have kids, maybe they need you to be healthy and active so you can chase them around and play with them. \nIf you have a partner, they may appreciate having an active partner to share activities with. \nAnd if you have friends who love to exercise, they’re probably missing your company on their runs or hikes.\nRemembering that there are people in your life who want you to be active can be a strong incentive to get moving again. \n//\nIn 2008, when tore my ACL, I was at the peak of my game. I was one of the best college track and field athletes in the country.\nMy injury was bad luck, but I had tasted being one of the best. I wanted to do everything I could do to get back to the top.\nSo I saw the doctors, I did the exercises, I trained hard to get back into things.\nThen in 2010 I tore my other ACL.\nThis time it was different. I was nearing the end of my college career. I was thinking about doing other things apart from sports. I didn’t care anymore about staying at the top of my performance.\nSo I went through the process of recovery, like last time.\nBut to be honest with you, moving and exercising was never the same again.\nMy whole life, I found meaning to exercise through competition. I wanted to beat my competitors, and I wanted to be the best.\nWhen that went away after my 2nd big injury, I couldn’t find anything that made me want to move and exercise anymore.\n//\nI lived with that struggle for 10 years.\nI had no idea what kind of exercise I wanted to do. Especially since I didn’t want to get injured again. There was too much frustration.\nNo matter how careful you are, or how much you prepare, there’s always the chance you’ll get injured. \nIt’s the reality of life. \nI don’t know anyone who has gone through their entire life without any kind of injury at all.\nIt’s impossible.\nIn the journey to finding movement again- and movement that is meaningful, there are a few ways of thinking that I find valuable.\n\nWhat movement makes it worth it?\nWhat movement feels like play?\nWhat movements do I want to explore?\n\n//\nWhat movements make it worth it?\nWhen it comes to figuring out what you want to do, it can be a tough journey. And people who have a sport they’re passionate about are very lucky\nRecently, I have started asking the question, “If I will continue to have some form of pain, what are the movements that I really care about, and would be worth working through my injury problems for”\nIf I have anxieties about injury and pain- so what activities can I do that would make it worthwhile for me? \nI have to choose something I love, so that if I get hurt and injured, I’ll find a way to keep growing and exploring.\nThese are very personal, and different for each of us.\nFor me, there is nothing I love more than when I’m hiking in the forest. And I would love to keep healthy and fit to be able to hike throughout my life.\nI have worked with someone who loves scuba diving, and her purpose in staying active and healthy is for that. Even when she has an injury or a setback, she’s eager to recover for her love of scuba diving.\nFor some, meaningful movement is biking and playing at the park with their kids. For some meaningful movement is finishing a marathon. There are so many possibilities for meaningful movement.\n//\nWhat feels like play?\nIt’s no secret that I’m a big fan of play. \nKids play all the time. They make up games and move around. But we forget how to play when we become adults. \nThis doesn’t mean you go back to your childhood games.\nIt’s more about asking:\n\nWhat are movements that let me explore?\nWhat are movements that let me be creative?\nWhat are movements that I find fun?\n\nInstead of thinking of play as a waste of time, think of play as something that is essential to our well being. It makes us more open and more creative.\nAfter all, even as adults, we still want to stay connected to our sense of wonder and our capacity for joy.\n//\nFind the fun\nHowever, there is one factor that I believe is more important than any other when it comes to choosing an exercise routine: the “fun factor.”\nYour chances of sticking to an exercise program are much higher if you choose something that you actually enjoy.\nIf you hate running, there’s no point in forcing yourself to go for a run every day. \nBut if you enjoy hiking, then make that a part of your routine. \nOr if you like playing in the playground, see if you can find a way to incorporate that into your workout.\nThe bottom line is that you should try to find an activity that feels like play rather than work. When you enjoy yourself, it’s much easier to stick with it.\nSo next time you’re wondering what exercise you should do, ask yourself this question: “What feels like play to me?” And then go do that.\n//\nA chance to explore\nFinally, getting injured, and being stuck in an injury mindset led down the path of exploring what it is that I love to do. It took me 10 years to break out of that mindset! (I don’t want it to take so long for you)\nSometimes, an injury can give you a chance to ask new questions and explore new things.\nThe best thing you can do is to be mentally flexible and adapt. If things don’t happen as you plan, try taking a different path.\nIt’s not always easy, but it’s important to lead you to discover the movement that is meaningful for you.\n//\nIn the end you have to find your WHY\nWhat is that thing that motivates you to keep on going forward\nMaybe it’s the sense of camaraderie you feel with your teammates. \nOr the feeling of accomplishment you get when you finally complete that difficult workout. \nOr maybe the vision of your kids and grandkids playing with you on the floor\nWhatever it is, finding that deeper meaning will help you stay motivated and focused on your recovery.\nThe road to recovery can be long and difficult. But it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. There are many others who have been in your shoes and come out the other side. Reach out to them for support and advice.

If you’re in Flow, it’s because these factors are doing well. If you are not in flow, then at least one factor isn’t doing well.\n\nMain Factors Governing the Strength of Each §\n\nDirection (re Flow) — Level of Clarity; Amount of Directions — Aside from “Nature &amp; Nurture” (which is a philosophical rabbit hole), it’s the Level of Clarity and Amount of Directions (i.e. the number of goals one has) that most govern the strength of Direction.\nAttention (re Flow) — Distractions in both Frequency and Intensity — This is most governed by Distractions: the Intensity of Distractions and the Frequency of Distractions.\nEnthusiasm (re Flow) — Level of Desire — This also ties into “Nature &amp; Nurture” a bit. It might sound circular, but one’s Level of Desire dictates one’s Enthusiasm. It’s the most intangible. What excites somebody? What inspires them, motivates them, fills them with passion? I’m not sure how to best affect one’s Enthusiasm. It’s the “Why” in the world of “Goal Setting.” It’s very personal to each person, but some commonalities are usually: to be stimulated and engaged, to feel important, to feel the work is important, to improve one’s financial situation.\nEnergy (re Flow) — Quality of Sleep, Diet, &amp; Exercise; Quality of Relationships &amp; Community; Quality of Leisure Time — also Hydration, Sunlight, Nature, Hobbies, etc.\n\nHow They Impact Each Other §\n\nIf Direction is clear and not diluted, then it’s easier to focus one’s Attention; Enthusiasm isn’t diluted; Energy isn’t wasted.\nIf Attention isn’t spread too thin amid myriad distractions, then it’s easier to stay on target in the ideal Direction; Enthusiasm isn’t diluted; Energy isn’t wasted.\nIf Enthusiasm is strong, then it’s easier to stay committed to one’s Direction; it’s easier to maintain one’s Attention; it’s easier to compensate for middling Energy levels.\nIf Energy is cultivated, then your Direction seems possible/doable/easier; You can more easily maintain your Attention; you can get work done even when you’re not feeling Enthusiasm (and through the process of doing the work, you can usually create new Enthusiasm).\n\nIf you have a Poor Diet (not included in the LYT Kit), then your Attention is going to suck: you’ll be more easily distracted; so you’ll spend time in other Directions; and thus you’ll dilute and dissipate your Enthusiasm. This one is a huge component that you can control. You can replace “Poor Diet” with “Lack of Sleep” and you’ll get similar results.\n\n\n"},"Notes/Four-Great-Chinese-Novels":{"title":"Four Great Chinese Novels","links":["tags/idea-note"],"tags":["idea-note"],"content":"alias:\ntags:#idea-note\nurl:\nTweet url: §\nIdea Name §\nContext / Source §\nKey Idea §\nThe four great Chinese novels are:\n\nMonkey King (Journey to the West) by Wu Cheng’en\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong\nWater Margin by Shi Nai’an\nDream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin\n\nSee also §"},"Notes/Four-preferences-when-doing-business":{"title":"Four preferences when doing business","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Four preferences when doing business §\nVisual\nEmotional\nFunctional\nFinancial\nSource\nE-myth business"},"Notes/Foxes-and-hedgehogs-(analogy)":{"title":"Foxes and hedgehogs (analogy)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Foxes and hedgehogs (analogy) §\nQuote Greek poet Archilochus\nThe fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing\nHeck if I know what this means\nBut neither is good or bad.\nThey just have specific skills"},"Notes/Frame-of-Reference-(concept)":{"title":"Frame of Reference (concept)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Frame of Reference (concept) §\nIn Physics, this is all about having a clear sense of what you’re basing things on.\n(Physics but also in humanities)\nIt’s this idea of you see based on where you are."},"Notes/Framing-by-Dysfunctional-belief":{"title":"Framing by Dysfunctional belief","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Framing by Dysfunctional belief §\nContext §\nIn the book desingning your life.\nThey tell a story\nand then talk about how that anecdote\nmanifests a dysfunctional belief\nthat is hurting us\nIn Psychology? §\nIs this just called reframing?\nWhat’s a good way to talk about this?\nTo show what it is"},"Notes/Framing":{"title":"Framing","links":["Notes/Priming","tags/concept"],"tags":["concept"],"content":"X:: Priming\ntags::#concept\nFraming §\nI’m the hidden 500 pound gorilla that underpins all human communication.\nIf you hear, “this doesn’t cost 1000,itonlycosts50!” That sounds great because it’s been framed in context to 1000.Buteven50 is a lot for a cup of coffee.\nThis is related to “moving the goalposts” and other cognitive biases (not included in the LYT Kit)\nWiki §\nThe Framing Effect: People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.

And so when when you’re a novice and you look at a problem it’s simplistic. I can solve world hunger, I can do this and then as you dive in it’s really freaking complicated right? There’s all these things you didn’t think of. And then on the other side of that complexity is simplicity and I think of that as simplicity.

But I’ve had little success since I started.\nMy problem: There are so many health coaches and I was struggling to set myself apart.\nEveryone says you need to find your niche, and I’ve been trying to do that online for a while. I was writing, posting on Twitter, building in public and trying to see what people were resonating with. But something still wasn’t clicking and I wasn’t sure what it was.\nThen I started working with Shruthi\nToday, I am clear about my niche and who I want to serve. My name is Javier and I help people stuck in a physical injury build up mental fitness to trust their body again.\nJust saying that gives me goosebumps because it fits so much with who I am as a person. I truly want to help people stuck in injury to enjoy their lives again.\nWhat was the one thing that helped you get insane clarity and propel your business forward?\nWorking with Shruthi is both fun and challenging. She is supportive and at the same time clear on what steps I need to take for growth.\nI got the most value when we did an exercise on thinking about my ideal customer. I’m done many customer avatar exercises before, but I was still afraid to narrow it down.\n“What if it’s too narrow?”\n“What if I’m limiting myself?”\n“What if there are people outside of my niche I want to help?”\nAll those questions were strong in my mind.\nShruthi helped me accept that it’s not just about me, it’s also about who I want to help. Who are the VERY specific people that I have the skills to help? Can I focus all my energy on finding and helping those people = aka my niche\nHow clear are your next steps of action after the coaching?\nNow that I know I’m focusing on people who need mental fitness to trust their body, I’m more propelled to write, research, and reach out.\nBack then, when I called myself a health coach, it was hard to find who I was talking to. Because everyone needs a health coach in some way. As I said, I couldn’t set myself apart.\nNow, when I see someone I can help, I want to go out of my way to offer them resources and support.\nIt’s simple, but it’s not easy- and this is the stage I’m practicing now. But having that clear niche of who I serve has made it clear what I need to do."},"Notes/computer-and-human-thinking":{"title":"computer and human thinking","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Computer and Human thinking §\nThe best kind of work is when we let two kinds of thinking complement each other\nComputer thinking and human thinking\nA computer is good at grinding.\nA computer has the time that we don’t\nWe can let the computer spit out a solution\nBut instead of just copying it\n(that’s cheating in chess)\nWe try to understand why is this good?\nThen we try to be creative\nAre there situations where this is not good?\nWhere can I learn from this?"},"Notes/eposvox-audio-videos":{"title":"eposvox audio videos","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"🤌 How to get PERFECT stream audio using ONLY OBS effects!
