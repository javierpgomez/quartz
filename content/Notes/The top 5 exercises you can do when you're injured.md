**The top 5 NEW exercises you can do when you're injured**

It's no secret that when you're injured, it can be really tough to get back into the swing of things. It's hard to know what exercises you can do when you're injured and feeling pain. And, of course, you don't want to do anything that will make the injury worse.

But did you know that one of the best things you can do for your body when you're injured is to start moving again? It may sound counter-intuitive, but it's true!

When you're injured, your body goes into protection mode. It's natural to want to protect the injured area and keep it from moving. But this can actually lead to more pain.

Your body is designed to move. It's made to be active. When you expose yourself to new movements, your body doesn't have the same fear associated with them. The body can adapt to many things, and you can trust your own body to get better.

So, if you're dealing with an injury, don't be afraid to start moving again. Try some new exercises and trust your body to heal itself.

Exposing your body to new movements will help it to adapt and heal. Trust your body to get better, and don't be afraid to move. 

Here are my five favorite exercises to explore when you're injured

1. Go dancing

Try going dancing. For many people, it is the perfect way to move, feel socially supported, and keep their minds sharp. Dancing is a great way to get your body moving and to feel supported by others. It's also a great way to keep your mind sharp. So if you're dealing with an injury, don't be afraid to give it a try.

1. Walking in nature: 

Walking is a great way to stay active while you're injured. It's low-impact, so it won't aggravate your injury, and it's a great way to get some fresh air and sunshine. Just listening to the crunch of leaves below your feet and feeling the sun on your skin can help you to feel better. So get out there and start moving!

2. Swimming:

Swimming is a great way to get some low-impact exercise. It's almost impossible to injure yourself if you're just swimming for fun. Plus it can let you explore bodily movements that would be impossible out of the water.

3. Try a martial art:

For some people Tai Chi is great. It helps your balance and flexibility. It can be meditative and relaxing.For others something new like Judo helps them learn a lot about their body and different positions. 

Studying a new martial art can also be a great way to gain a new perspective on your body. It can help you to understand how your body moves and how to use its natural strengths.

4. Crawling and animal flow

Try crawling and animal movements. Can you even remember the last time you were crawling? We did it all the time as kids, and then as we got older we just stopped doing that altogether. But there are a lot of benefits to moving on your hands and palms again! Crawling helps to improve your body awareness and proprioception (the ability to know where your body is in space). It also helps to strengthen the muscles in your shoulders, arms, and hands. And it's not just good for your physical health - crawling can also help to reduce stress and anxiety. When you move your body in new ways, it helps to release tension and feel more relaxed. So don't be afraid to get down on all fours and start crawling around! Your body will thank you for it.

### It's about exploration

A key thing to remember here is that you're not doing these exercises INSTEAD. These are not poor man's versions of your favorite activities.

You are doing these to explore, and to expose your body to movement again.

Your goal here is to have the right mindset- and to tell yourself, "I am moving my body because I am safe, my body can recover, and I don't need to be afraid of moving too much"
