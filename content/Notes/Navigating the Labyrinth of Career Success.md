Success is a chameleon, often taking on the hues of our workplace culture and societal expectations. In the race for the corner office, it's easy to chase milestones set by the very environment we compete in—money, titles, the visible markers of ‘making it’. Like Pac-Man, we gobble up these dots along our career path, often without questioning whether the maze we're in leads to a destination we actually desire.

But here I am, trying to carve out a path that is authentically mine, seeking a victory in a game that aligns with my values, not just the high score someone else has set. I reflect on the numerous stories of those who've climbed the traditional ladder of success, only to discover it was leaning against the wrong wall. It's an all-too-common narrative that begs the question: Are we pursuing what truly fulfills us, or are we simply collecting the accolades and affirmations of a game we don't enjoy?

It's critical to step back and assess the metrics we use to define our own success. Are they monetary, or do they relate to the impact and fulfillment we gain? Do our careers reflect our passions, or are they merely a reflection of societal norms and expectations? As I forge my own path, I'm reminded that success, much like happiness, is deeply personal and cannot be distilled into a universal formula.

It's about finding the balance between personal growth, financial stability, and the joy of the work itself. The conversations I've had with those who've walked this road, the kayak guides and bankers alike, underscore the diversity of fulfillment in work. Their stories serve as waypoints, guiding me to consider not only the end goal but also the texture and color of the journey itself.

In shaping my career, I'm not looking for a map but rather a compass—pointing towards what gives my work meaning beyond the conventional scorecard. The real victory lies not in the accolades I collect but in playing a game that feels like my own—where the measures of success are tailored to my aspirations, where the path I walk is one I've chosen, not one chosen for me.
