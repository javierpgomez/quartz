# Mycelia is a process

Not just an organism

It's an invitation to think of yourself as a dynamic object.
Not just something that is static and unchanging

Always adapting and always changing to different stimuli and the world around you.
Trying to discover new ways of being.
And interacting with your surroundings constantly.
