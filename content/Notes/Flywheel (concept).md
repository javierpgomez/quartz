# Flywheel (concept)

A flywheel is something that's so slow to start.
But once you get it going, it just stays going.

This is an analogy for a system
That takes a lot of effort to start up
But once it's up and running
It takes much less effort to sustain

[[Notes/Momentum]]

David Perell just used a Jeff Bezos example.
Not quite.
But it's a system that can operate even without the founder in place.

## Counter Example

Here at Bagac
They just do thing manually all the time
But if you want to work smart
and have more leverage
Set up a system
That will be able to work even when you're gone.
