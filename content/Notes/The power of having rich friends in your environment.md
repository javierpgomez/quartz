### Key Idea

The findings suggest that if a poor child grows up in a neighborhood where 70 percent of their friends are wealthy—the typical rate for higher-income children—then their future income would rise on average by 20 percent. This is roughly equivalent to the difference between having a high school diploma and a college degree.
