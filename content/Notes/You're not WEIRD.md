# You're not WEIRD

This stands for Western educated, industrialized, rich and democratic societies
(WEIRD)

— who represent as much as 80 percent of study participants, but only 12 percent of the world’s population 
— are not only unrepresentative of humans as a species, but on many measures they’re outliers.

## As a concept

It's when you take studied information that applies to one context (usually the WEIRD context). And try to apply it to your own.

## Story

When I'm gardening
Spring is the time to plant right?
to get summer crop
Wrong! In the Philippines, May is when we harvest and rest the land
July is when we plant new crops

[[Notes/The timing of festivals and dictating seasons]]

## Application

To me this means that we do have to take these studies with a grain of salt

This is why you should
[[Notes/Adopt an experimenter's mindset]]
There are studies, and then there is you
