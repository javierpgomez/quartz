Performance is a moving target, a spectrum with complacency at one end and peak potential at the other. When I think about how I'm doing, there's always this nagging question—am I truly giving it my all? Have I reached my full potential or am I stuck on a plateau?

This is the "delta" that Dr. Julie Gurner talks about—the gap between how we're performing and the potential for our performance. It's a healthy space to dwell in mentally because it guards against stagnation. It also holds a mirror up to our limitations, offering a window into what we could become.

Complacency is the enemy of greatness. Like sitting in a warm bath until the water turns cold, it lulls us into a false sense of contentment. But that delta? It's a constant poke in the side, a reminder that we could be doing more, being more.

Let's take this idea to the gym for a moment. Think of exercise as a form of performance. If you're lifting the same weight every time you go to the gym, are you really growing? The body craves variation, challenge, stress even, to evolve.

In the context of coaching, this delta concept offers an interesting tool. It's not just about helping people perform better but about helping them to envision a more expansive version of themselves. This perspective promotes not just the attainment of goals but the constant recalibration of those goals. A moving target is harder to hit, but it's also more rewarding when you do.

Now, if you excuse me, I need to reevaluate some of my own targets. There's a delta waiting to be narrowed.

Note: Remember, this concept is vital but not a standalone solution. The idea of this 'delta' can be an effective motivator, but it has to be integrated within a larger framework of self-improvement and wellness strategies. And yes, it's easier said than done. But hey, nobody said closing the delta was going to be easy.
