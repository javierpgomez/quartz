# Kids is rounding out the human experience 

## Context 

I just like the way he articulates it.
It resonates with me because I like that it's not about "The right thing to do"
Or it's not about morals or obligations.

## What is the quote

Justin Kan said "You'll never feel ready" or you won't feel prepared.
[[Just do it]]
[[don't need to feel stable and prepared]]

He said that having kids would round out the human experience.
And that's a great way to put it.
Of course it's hard and it's a lot of work.
But that's such a great way to say it.
