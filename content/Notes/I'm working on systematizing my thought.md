# I'm working on systematizing my thought

Getting some core ideas down
There are principles kasi that apply to all clients 
Even though I mix and match them naman

Right now, the way I'm working is that I'll apply some thing to some people.
And it's fine.
It's a way to be personalized
And have things that work for some people

But my now I have some experience
and I should be able to generalize some kind of process for people

and I can feel very secure and confident because
it's not like they can apply it to themselves

I used here the [[Notes/PARA framework of Tiago Forte]]
