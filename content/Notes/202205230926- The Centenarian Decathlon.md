# My writing (250-300 words)

The decathlon is 2 days 10 events
Running jumping throwing

What would 2 days (a weekend )
Look like when you're in your 100s

Saturday
- Go for a walk every morning
- Do the grocery - carry bags from the car to the kitchen
- Prep a full meal - coordination around the kitchen
- Going for a swim, getting out of the pool unassisted
- Gardening in the evening 


Sunday
- Load a bag into a car (or an overhead bin)
- Walk up several flights of stairs
- Pick up a grandchild that's running at you
- Comfortably playing on the floor
- Get up off the ground with one arm of support
