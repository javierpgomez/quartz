# Conversation is prototyping 

It's like talking is draft and ideation

I'm pretty good at this
Because I get to talk a lot

But writing is really riskier
and asks you to be more rigorous

--

By talking to other people
You get to practice and experiment with your ideas

When you start writing
It gets a little bit riskier
Because the ideas are now written down
