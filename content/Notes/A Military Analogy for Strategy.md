## Key Ideas

- This analogy applies to learning something new
	- Don't brute force your way through it

- When you're trying to conquer new territroy
	- You can't brute force it all the time
- Think of an invading army, and how it conquers new territory
- It happens in three stages
	1. The commando stage
	2. The infantry stage
	3. The police stage

### The commando stage
- These are the marines
- they are the specialists specialists
- People who have the tactical skills that are adapted to a very specific situation
- This is when you bring in an expert (or a coach)
- These are the first 8 weeks
- You need the specialist to help you set up system
- penetrate the battle ground;
- get you started; give you a strategy and figure out the most efficient path and way to go

### The Infantry Stage
- This is when you apply some more force
- You execute your strategy
- Now that you have a beachead. And you've entered the territory
- You can bring in troops and get it going.
- This stage is a bit of a grind

### The Law Enforcement Stage
- This is where it's all about maintenance
- You're already doing well
- You have a good habit
- And you need to just remind yourself to realign every now and then
