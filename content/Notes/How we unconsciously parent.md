I read this really powerful article from [[Steven Schlafman]]. It's all about how when we parent, we come up against a lot of our past selves and trauma.

And I can definitely see this happening for me also.

I'm going to become a father soon, and I can help but feel like I have to fully deal with my own parenting trauma as I go through it

From the article:
>When we fully embrace our consciousness, particularly as parents, we must be willing to see and accept all aspects of ourselves, including those that we may have disowned or rejected in the past. 
>
>But by taking ownership of our projections and facing our past experiences, we can develop a profound sense of self-compassion and self-love. 
>
>When we extend the same level of care and understanding to ourselves that we offer to our children, we have the ability to heal old wounds, shift our behavior patterns, and ultimately become the parents we needed.

That reminds of Ursula LeGuinn's quote: "An Adult is not a dead child but a child that survived."
