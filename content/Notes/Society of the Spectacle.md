Seems to me the real question becomes what if anything changes about our experience of the items that make up our life when are produced specifically to be bought, sold or traded? 

Well, one important thing, they'd say changes is that the material things around you that make your life possible, your toaster, your shoes, your bed, and everything else in your life, for that matter, practically all this stuff was cultivated, produced and manufactured somewhere else, and you have no idea where that is usually this stuff was brought into existence by someone else and you have no idea who they are. Usually say what you want as a fan of capitalism about the efficiency of these modern conditions of production. That's undeniable. But there was always a trade off and one of the trade offs here from Marks and de boer is going to be that the consumer is fundamentally alienated from the creative process of everything that they buy that performs an important function in their

life, because we no longer have to actually make the stuff that we use every day. We don't ever have to consider all the other people.

You can't just choose to abstain from the economic system. Like someone can just walk out of a catholic mass. If they think it's all nonsense, you have to be a part of it in some way. And as you do that, there are literally teams of people out there working in close correlation with algorithms. Super smart people where their entire job is to look at your tendencies on these screens and find any way they can to get you to spend more time contemplating the spectacle instead of living, there is so much more to talk about here

You see the same thing emerged at the heads of companies in the private sector, you have these enormously powerful people that are the faces of giant businesses and you're sold. What feels like a marketing campaign about how brilliant these people are. Like they're playing 4D chess at a level no one can fully understand because they're just not as smart as them. But then you do some digging into the other side of the story and it's like, are these people really unparalleled intellects of our time that are gonna save the world or is this a marketing campaign? I'm being sold to instill confidence in shareholders because the markets based on mass psychology. Again, the funny thing to Tabor is that even if it is just a marketing campaign for a lot of people out there. It doesn't even really bother them that much.

That's interesting because the goal of society is to separate you from the means of everything. I was really struck by phrase and idea of being separated to the means of consumption. Like the goal of capitalism is not separate you from what you make but also from what you consume.

You have no idea where anything comes from. And you are worse of (or better depending on your perspective) either way, your stuff just works like a magical object.

That reminds me [The fragility of food systems](Notes/The%20fragility%20of%20food%20systems.md) and [The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](Notes/The%20Ones%20Who%20Walk%20Away%20from%20Omelas.md)

It's similar because food systems are the same. No one knows where food comes from. It's just like magic. When you start to think about where your food actually comes from you have no idea. And I like to know. Because I want to be responsible. I want to take responsibilty for what I eat, earn and do.

It's different because For some people this is a good thing. Being able to not think about where you are getting things from.

It's important because it's important to know. If you want to be a responsible person, you should do this.
