# Idea Name

### Context / Source
M. Soledad Caballero â€” Someday I Will Visit Hawk Mountain

### Key Idea

This poem is really great because it talks about the difference between knowing something in a book

and knowing something in reality

You can know something like a textbook

But real experience is where knowledge lies
