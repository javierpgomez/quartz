# My writing (250-300 words)

In the early 20th century, weightlifting was new- and no one suggested it

Very few people believed in weightlifitng. In fact the belief was that if you got too muscular you would get slow and inflexible. So doctors actively prescribed against weight lifting. There was the fear of becoming 'muscle-bound'- which was the belief that you would get so musculuar that you could no longer move!

We take it for granted today because we all accept weights as a good thing

It's easy to look back and pooh pooh how silly they are back then

But are we any smarter now? Well yes- and no. We know much more, we have science and our knowledge as a society has grown! But! We don't know everything- and to think we do is to fall into the "End of History Illusion"- that false belief that what we know now is the pinnacle of everything we'll ever know

There's so much out there still to learn

What areas do you think you know all there is to know?

Remember the Dunning-Krugger effect. Those that don't know a lot are the ones who think they know the most. So always keep that in mind. Don't let yourself slip into the place where you think you know everything that there is to know. If you do- you might be falling into that trap.

Are there places you're unwilling to change your mind?
