# My writing (250-300 words)

Building in this solid system of reflection

Like being able to circle back and to know what's working and what's not working

Then you can reflect

So I imagine it would include things like

Here's what it was like for me
Here's what worked
Here's what didn't work
Here's what I would do differently

But as a coach I can add value by giving some kind of input
Like- you might want to check out this video it can help

then reflect - decide what your next experiment will be based on that
