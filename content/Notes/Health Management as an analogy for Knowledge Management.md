# Health Management as an analogy for Knowledge Management

## Source
- [[Notes/Tiago Forte]]

## Key Idea
- Tiago Forte uses this phrase Knowledge Management
- and how he teaches people how to do that.

- So I'd like to teach Health Management
- Have a constellation of software
- to help you manage your health

## But
- isn't that just building a second brain already?
- Why reinvent the wheel here.
- Especially if you're supposed to be app agnostic
