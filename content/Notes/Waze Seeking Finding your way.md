# Waze and finding your way

I love using Waze.
If you're somehow not familiar- Waze is a navigation app. It's a GPS that will give you the best route when you're going for a drive.

The reason I like it is because I don't have to overthink.
And it's one less thing to worry about when I'm driving.

I love letting go and just letting Waze tell me where to go and what to do.

It's especially useful when I'm in a new place, and I'm trying to navigate new territory.
It will usually give me the best route.
And help me know exactly where to go.
Again incredibly handy when in an unfamiliar place

I remember when we were doing a roadtrip in Scotland
and we were up in the highlands.
Waze would be the one that would be the most reliable

## Waze is copying

The trick with Waze is that you're just copying.
It's just emulation. 
You don't have to think.
You just do what you're told.

In a sense, it's like having a fitness coach
Someone who tells you exactly what to do.
How to do it
And gives you feedback if you're doing something wrong.

Waze gives that kind of instant feedback too.
Waze is always "recalculating" and trying to find a better route
And if you make a wrong turn, waze also tries to help you get back on track.

## When Waze doesn't work

But over time, as you use waze,
you start to realize that it doesn't always give the best results.
It's good maybe 95% of the time
But sometimes, your own experience can kick in
and tell you that this time, Waze isn't exactly right

## Personal Experience

Your familiarity with an area can outsmart waze
I know this area near where I live.
And the fastest route passes through the front of this huge factory
and at 5pm it's full of people getting of work. Cars, motorcycles. Packed

Waze doesn't really know that that's going to happen.
So if it's around that time,
and I need to get home. 
Waze won't give me the best answer
I can rely on my personal experience now to make a good choice

Also it can't really account for your human preferences
Sometimes when I go on a drive,
I don't always take the fastest, shortest route
I'll take the route which I enjoy more.
Or I'll take the route with less turns and less stoplights
That way I'm less stressed

I can account for my own personal preferences when driving.
And what kind of experience I'd like to have.

## Personal Coaching

When getting fitness coaching, try to take that into account as well.
Maybe in the beginning you're copying waze
you're doing what your coach says.
You delegate all that responsibility to someone else

But over time, if you are mindful
You start to get a feel of what you like.
What works for you and what doesn't work for you.
The things you enjoy.

And then you can start to take ownership of your own health and practice.
You can say to yourself
Oh I understand that I like this
Oh I understand that I don't like that

Today I'll see what my waze / coach has to offer
Oh today I want to take this route
I want to do this exercise because I enjoy it more.
I want to have fun today.
I need to do things fast today.
I need to push myself today.
I need to enter into new territory today
