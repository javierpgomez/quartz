When you buy an iPhone just works out of the box. And then you just plug, play, and use it. That's why so many people pay so much for iPhones. (Okay yes prestige marketing etc) But the iOS ecosystem also *just* works.

I could try to build an iPhone from scratch. Or a lot of indie hacker types spend forever customizing the *perfect* system, phone, device for themselves.

But you end up spending ALL this time customizing and building, and never actually using your device.

A thought I had here:
While no health system is plug and play, can I think of a health system that is 90% of the way. Like an iPhone.

All you have to do is some slight 10% (or even 5%) customization, and then it becomes a powerful tool for you to work on your health?
