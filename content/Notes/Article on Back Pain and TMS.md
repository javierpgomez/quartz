### Key Ideas

That's interesting because of how many people still do not believe in TMS. and how much of an uphill battle this is becoming.

That reminds me of the difficulty in changing people's minds
It's similar because whether religion or philosophy, paradigm shifts are hard to change.
It's different because this one is in the body and not just an idea
It's important because we are learning that everything is connected, so we have to deal with that.
