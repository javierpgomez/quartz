# The tyranny of the one right choice

## Source:
- Designing your life

## Story
- Buying apple products
- Then the new one would launch
- and I'd wonder if I made the right choice

- But we can reframe
- You have more than one choice,
- and there are several right choices

- You don't have to optimize for the perfect choice
