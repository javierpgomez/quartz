# China's EV model (story)

## Context
I was watching a video about electric vehicles in China

## What is it

I found China's EV model really interesting.
In that you replace batteries instead of charge them.
I don't know the full context
Or how they're executing it.
But it's interesting compared to a charging model

## Interesting

It's interesting to my because the idea of switching out batteries instead of charging them is differetn.
