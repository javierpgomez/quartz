### Key Idea

When you're old, the goal is to be able to be independent. It's not about movements per se, but it is about freedom and independence. You should be able to do what you want, when you want, without having to rely on others. That doesn't mean you can't ask for help when you need it, but it does mean you're not a burden to others. It's a great goal to strive for, and it's something that gets easier with practice.
