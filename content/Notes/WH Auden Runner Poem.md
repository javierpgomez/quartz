The Camera's Eye does not lie
But it cannot show the life within
The life of a runner 
Or yours or mine

That race which is neither fast nor slow
For nothing can ever happen twice

That story which moves like music
When begotten notes, new notes begin
Making the flowing of time a growing
Till what it could be at last it is

Where fate is freedom
Grace and surprise
