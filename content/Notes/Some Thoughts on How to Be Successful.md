I'm constantly on the lookout for people's opinion's and ideas on what it takes to be successful...

Here are some insights from Sam Altman-- famously (or notoriously?) the CEO of OpenAI (aka ChatGPT's parent company)

His first idea:

> If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.

I wonder how I can apply this to health and fitness.

I will say that I've fallen off quite a bit when it comes to writing, making notes and putting ideas out there. 

At this point, I just need to be willing to go for it, and not overthink it too much!

------
Secondly:

>Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.

This is one I've been working on for a while.

I joined writing and entreprenuerial communities in the past 2 years, all with the goal of helping me write, express my ideas and really get myself out there more and more.

and Finally:

>The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.

This is a pretty easy one for me-- 

I need to authentically buy into what I'm doing, otherwise, I can't convince anyone else that it's worth doing at all.
