**Efficiency vs. Diversity: Striking a Balance**

While diversity within a workforce is lauded for enhancing productivity and fostering innovation, the complexity of integrating a myriad of contractors—especially smaller, less efficient ones—raises questions about the actual efficiency of such practices.

In the high-stakes arena of semiconductor fabrication, where precision and consistency are paramount, the underlying assumption that diversity is a productivity boon must be scrutinized. For me, it's clear: diversity is a multi-faceted concept that, when improperly managed, can indeed lead to inefficiencies.

As proposed, to disentangle the noble objective of uplifting woman-owned businesses from the intricate and technologically demanding task of semiconductor fabrication could be the strategic clarity needed in industrial policy.

The notion holds water—the goals of diversity and industry excellence need not be conjoined at the hip, and could be pursued independently for better outcomes.

From my experience, when dealing with an operation as delicate as fab construction, a seamless and streamlined process trumps the diversity quota. However, this does not negate the pursuit of diversity. Rather, it calls for a more nuanced approach, where diversity initiatives are designed to complement, not compromise, operational effectiveness.

**A Thoughtful Unbundling**

If we accept Ezra's perspective, the deliberate unbundling of objectives presents a clearer path to achieving both without the friction of one impeding the other. It's about being pragmatic—strategically fostering diversity in areas where it naturally fits, while maintaining a laser focus on efficiency where it's most critical.

Ultimately, this nuanced approach to industrial policy—where we harness the strengths of a diverse workforce without losing sight of core operational goals—may pave the way for a more productive and inclusive industry.
