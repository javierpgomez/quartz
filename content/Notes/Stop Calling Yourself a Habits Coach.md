### Key Ideas

The idea behind this statement is that people are not necessarily interested in developing good habits for their own sake, but rather they are motivated by the results that good habits can bring. For example, someone may not be interested in developing a habit of regular exercise, but they may be motivated by the desire to fit back into a specific dress that they haven't been able to wear in a while.

This concept also suggests that coaches should avoid identifying themselves as "habits coaches" or other specific labels, as people are not typically searching for a coach in that specific area. Instead, coaches should focus on meeting clients where they are currently at and understanding their specific goals and motivations. This will allow the coach to better tailor their approach and connect with the client on a deeper level.

Additionally, the idea is also pointing out that coaches often make the mistake of diving too deep into the coaching process too soon before earning the right to do so. It's important for coaches to understand that building trust and rapport with the clients is essential to be able to take them where they want to go, and the process of earning trust takes time.

In summary, the idea is that people are motivated by the results of good habits, not the habits themselves. Coaches should focus on understanding the clients' goals and meeting them where they are currently at, rather than identifying themselves as a specific type of coach. Building trust and rapport is essential to be able to take the clients where they want to go.
