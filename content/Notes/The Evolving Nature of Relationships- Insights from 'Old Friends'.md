"Old Friends" offers a poignant reflection on the changing nature of relationships over time, emphasizing the idea that we never meet the same person twice, not even in the same person. This concept resonates deeply with the notion that in any long-term relationship, whether it be friendship, love, or family, individuals evolve and thus, the relationship evolves with them.

The narrative set in New York's autumnal backdrop, a city emblematic of constant change, parallels the author's personal transformations with each visit. The authorâ€™s experiences, from youthful adventures on a tight budget to more indulgent encounters later in life, mirror the evolving nature of human desires and perspectives.

Central to this piece is the observation of old friendships - with H, A, and J - and the value found in witnessing each otherâ€™s life trajectories over the years. This witnessing, as David Whyte puts it, is the "ultimate touchstone of friendship." It's not about constantly improving each other, but rather about being present and observant of each other's lives.

The author reflects on the dynamics of long-term relationships, noting that some grow distant when shared understanding dwindles, leading to a profound sense of loss. Henrik Karlsson's perspective on relationships as either stagnant or fluid adds depth to this reflection, suggesting that some relationships adapt and grow with us, while others remain static.

The metaphor of intertwined roots in long-standing friendships beautifully captures the essence of deep connections. These are relationships where exchanges of words, ideas, or songs at critical life moments become integral to our identity and thought processes.

Your note, referencing the quote about being married multiple times, sometimes to the same person, aligns perfectly with the theme of this piece. It underscores the idea that as we evolve, our relationships must adapt and transform to remain relevant and meaningful. This could mean growing together in the same direction or accepting divergent paths as a natural part of life's journey.

In conclusion, "Old Friends" and your reflective note encapsulate the complexity and beauty of human relationships. They highlight the importance of acknowledging and embracing change within ourselves and in those around us. This perspective encourages a deeper appreciation for the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of connections that weave through the tapestry of our lives.
