# My writing (250-300 words)

In health, you also want to fail fast to learn right away. The more mistakes you make, the faster you will learn

There is a big caveat here- failure does not mean persisting in pain.

It's fine to make a mistake, and feel a bit of pain when you do- but it is not good or smart to persist in pain. You're just going to make things worse for you.

So in fitness, failing fast means making quick mistakes
