### Key Ideas

**Before and after**

It's been 2 years since I doubled down on being a health coach. But I've had little success since I started. 

My problem: There are so many health coaches and I was struggling to set myself apart.

Everyone says you need to find your niche, and I've been trying to do that online for a while. I was writing, posting on Twitter, building in public and trying to see what people were resonating with. But something still wasn't clicking and I wasn't sure what it was.

Then I started working with Shruthi

Today, I am clear about my niche and who I want to serve. My name is Javier and **I help people stuck in a physical injury build up mental fitness to trust their body again.** 

Just saying that gives me goosebumps because it fits so much with who I am as a person. I truly want to help people stuck in injury to enjoy their lives again.

**What was the one thing that helped you get insane clarity and propel your business forward?**

Working with Shruthi is both fun and challenging. She is supportive and at the same time clear on what steps I need to take for growth.

I got the most value when we did an exercise on thinking about my ideal customer. I'm done many customer avatar exercises before, but I was still afraid to narrow it down.

"What if it's too narrow?"
"What if I'm limiting myself?"
"What if there are people outside of my niche I want to help?"

All those questions were strong in my mind. 

Shruthi helped me accept that it's not just about me, it's also about who I want to help. Who are the VERY specific people that I have the skills to help? Can I focus all my energy on finding and helping those people = aka my niche

**How clear are your next steps of action after the coaching?**

Now that I know I'm focusing on people who need mental fitness to trust their body, I'm more propelled to write, research, and reach out.

Back then, when I called myself a health coach, it was hard to find who I was talking to. Because everyone needs a health coach in some way. As I said, I couldn't set myself apart.

Now, when I see someone I can help, I want to go out of my way to offer them resources and support.

It's simple, but it's not easy- and this is the stage I'm practicing now. But having that clear niche of who I serve has made it clear what I need to do.
