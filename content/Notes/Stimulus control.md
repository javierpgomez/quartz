# Stimulus control

This is from the Transtheoritical Model Paper

Promoting your healthy behaviour 
The example the paper gives is putting walking shoes in a highly visible spot
to me this is triggering good behaviors instead of bad behaviors

I got this idea down
It's like creating triggers

I'm sure Atomic Habits has some of these ideas in place already.

### Side note:
My thing with the transtheoretical model is that it's too technical
and it's not what peple need to hear or would be interested in.
It's only useful for an academic
Or someone who's looking for technical language to help them describe what's going on.
