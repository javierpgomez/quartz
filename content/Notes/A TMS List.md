The following lists will help you identify what aspects of your past, present, and personality attribute to your symptoms. You may use this page as a template for your own journal, or print this out for hand-written entries.

Some aspect of these lists will be part of every journal exercise you do. Each list has 15 places to be filled in, but don't feel like you have to complete these lists all at once. You will be adding to these lists throughout the program, so keep your lists in a safe place, somewhere that no one else will find.
