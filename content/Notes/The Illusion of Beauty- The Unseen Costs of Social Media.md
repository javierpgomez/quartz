The influence of social media on beauty standards is both startling and pervasive. It's impossible for me to ignore the 2021 study highlighting that an overwhelming majority of female participants felt obligated to conform to societal beauty norms. And more concerning is the 90% who admitted to using filters or editing tools to present an "ideal" image. It's a distorted reality, not just for the viewer but also for the one posting.

The unsettling fact that people only recognize manipulated images 60% of the time, according to a 2017 study, signals a growing disconnect between reality and the virtual world. It's a problem that I firmly believe won't correct itself through market forces alone. Without some form of oversight or regulation, the gap between real and 'Instagram real' is only going to widen.

This isn't just about aesthetics; it's a mental health issue. The constant pressure to adhere to an unattainable standard can have severe implications on self-esteem and body image, leading to a vicious cycle of digital manipulation and mental stress. The whole situation needs reevaluation, both from social media platforms and from regulatory bodies.

In my opinion, leaving this unregulated is akin to ignoring a ticking time bomb. The mental and emotional toll is too significant to be dismissed as a mere byproduct of technological advancement. This is a social issue that demands immediate and thoughtful action.
