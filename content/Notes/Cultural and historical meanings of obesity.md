Gout is the rich man's disease

And I don't think anybody would have looked down upon it too negatively. Back in medical school, I remember learning about gout and how gout emerged around this time. 

And it was really this disease of excess, right, excess alcohol, excess sugar, excess protein would manifest itself in gout. And this was the ultimate rich man's disease, basically a sign of affluence. 

So I can't imagine people were too upset to be obese back then. 

And of course, today we take it for granted despite some of the political pressure to understandably try to de stigmatize obesity and somehow now suggest that it's completely healthy.

I think the reality of it is it's pretty unambiguous that obesity is indeed associated with poor health outcomes. 

When did that become clear?
