### Key Idea

Doing small things is challenging, and motivation is a problem. Doing simple tings is always a hard sell

It feels better to crush your exercise instead 

I think it has to do with the way our brains are wired. We're wired to seek out challenge and novelty, and so when we're doing something simple, it feels like we're not really accomplishing anything.

But the truth is, doing small things is just as challenging as doing big things, and it's important to remember that when you're feeling demotivated.
