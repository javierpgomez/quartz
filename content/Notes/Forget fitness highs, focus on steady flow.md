### Key Idea

Most people think of health as being on the podium

They chase that 15 minute fitness high. It's getting the medal- and standing at the peak. Hitting the goal. And those feel great. For about 15 minutes. We love those 15 minute feeling of wins. Finishing that marathon. Getting that medal. Completing that task. Losing 30 pounds.

But you don't want to collect podium moments- those don't make you healthy

--

If you want to be healthy, think of the park- not the podium

You'll never have 15 minutes of glory in the park or playground. But that's what health looks like. Daily walking. Hanging on monkey bars. Balancing. Being on the swings. All these things are what really make you health

So even if you never hit the podium- you're still healthy
