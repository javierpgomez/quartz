# Transtheoretical model can be useful

Transtheoretical model has been used for all sorts of things

Usually with addiction
But can be applied to all sorts of behaviours 

There are two processes
Cognitive processes and
Behavioural processes

Cognitive processes have to do with how you think

And behavioral processes have to do with how you act.
