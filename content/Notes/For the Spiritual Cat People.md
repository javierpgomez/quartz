From the article:

>Cats experience spaciousness as love, so when you offer space, the cat comes to you. 
>
>They like being permitted to be the judge of when itâ€™s safe to come and make a friend. 
>
>Friendship is on their terms, not yours. 
>
>Meeting a new goldren retriever ( oh my goodness who is the best and fluffiest yes it is YOU yes it is YOU oh you are SO SOFT how did you GET SO SOFT!??!?) is going to be a very different experience than meeting a new cat 
>
>(#NotAllCats, some cats are very doggy, we are painting with broad strokes for this metaphor) 

That's interesting because this is what I think about when I think of spirituality. Not some hardcore evangelization methods.

But more of creating the space, attracting people and leaning in quietly.
