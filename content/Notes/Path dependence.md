This is when you do things a lot and it creates "paths" in your brain
Like a wheelbarrow going through the forest
eventually it creates a path
a "rut"

it's easier to take that path. It looks more attractive
It's hard not to take that path
Eventually you end up doing the same thing over and over again

Even if at some point it becomes harmful to you.

## Ants and initial bias

This is niche
But when I was doing the ACO math research
There was the initial bias of the ants
and how that was problematic
You'd end up with local minimums
unideal

## Brain is lazy

The truth is your brain is lazy
You may think you have a ton of energy
to do all sorts of things
but eventually
the brain will revert to automation

Because it cannot exert energy focus on everything all of the time
[[Notes/Pain is Complex]]
and how the brain dumps the management of pain to different parts of the brain

so if you're focusing very hard on something
and pushing yourself in some kind of way.
Just remembr that everything else is running on autopilot
and the truth is that there's nothing you can really do about that.
It's just the nature of it
and that's how it's going to be

## Implications

### Give yourself time to get out of paths you've established
Even if you're trying to change your behavior
the path you've set up
will be a consistent behavior for a while
that's just the nature of how it is.
It's not something that you can just change in an instant

### Use paths to help you make new paths

I feel like I could illustrate this
to get the idea
like a forking path network kind of illustration

links also to James Clear
habit anchoring I think
[[Habit Stacking by James Clear]]

Where you use existing paths to help you make new paths

So for example.
If I wanted to stop drinking
But I use drinking to alleviate stress
then I just have to find another habit that I do
and link my desired behavior to that

Say I want to stop drinking
But if I have no beverage I'll drink

Every time I sit down for dinner
I'm going to open a bottle of juice / coke / fizzy water
and I'll drink that

I won't really be tempted to open a bottle of wine
Because I already have an open bottle here.

I could find smaller bottles?
I don't know how effective that would be

## Don't fight Just accept

One thing that needs to happen here is that you need to accept it
It's tempting to think that I'm strong and I'm different
and I can force myself to do the things I want to do

But we're all human. No one is an exception to all the brain science that's out there
It's just a fact of our biology

(any kind of change over our biology still happens on a biological level if that makes any sense)
So it's really inevitable

## Links and Ideas

There's a lot of neuroscience that supports this also

This has links
to addiction
and [[Notes/Forming Habits (concept)]]

This also has links to..
[[Notes/Hysteresis (concept)]]
