# Inverse thinking (Concept Mental Model)

The idea here is that you don't have to always be right.
You don't have to be right more.
You just have to be wrong less.
This is a healthier way of thinking

In fitness. 
You don't have to run more.
You just have to sit a bit less.
(That's maybe easier for you)

(Inverse thinking is a bit of a weird term though)
