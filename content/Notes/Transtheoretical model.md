# Transtheoretical model (Framework)

## Context

It's linked to addiction

Anyone who's tried to change their behaviour knows this
There's a nice cycle model

Education helps

It just feels a bit highbrow

## Conceps and the model

Social liberation is a great concept
Increasing opportunity for alternative healthier behaviors
Socially liberate yourself 

Making your own user manual would be super good for this

## Application

If I can base a fitforlife system on these principles
That would be good
