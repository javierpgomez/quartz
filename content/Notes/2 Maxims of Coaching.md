Coaching well is overwhelming. There's so much to learn.

BJ Fogg is the author of Tiny Habits. He's a professor at Stanford and a researcher who focuses on behavior change. To cut through all the coaching tips, BJ Fogg gives 2 clear maxims that shift to focus to your client.

When it doubt, check- where am I on these 2 maxims?

## Maxim 1: Help them do what they already want to do

We all want to be better. But getting there isn't so simple.

Maxim 1 is reminds us: "The goals don't come from the coach, they come from the client." As a coach, my goal is to listen to you, understand what your goal is, and then offer my experience to help you do what you already want to do.

Highlight the desire that they already have.

## Maxim 2: Help them feel successful

The trick to long term change is to string together small successes.

You might feel like this is cheating- and that you shouldn't celebrate until you hit you big goal at the end. But the opposite is true. Our brain loves feeling like it's winning. And by giving it small wins, it's willing to do more of that. Make your clients feel like they're already succeeding- in small ways. That will spur them on to more successes.

Use these maxims as a check in- to see if you're focusing on your clients' progress
