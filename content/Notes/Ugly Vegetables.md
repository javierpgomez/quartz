### Context / Source


### Key Idea

There's so much food that gets wasted because it doesn't look good

Somehow, somewhere, we developed this bias towards good looking food. I suppose if I'm sticking to my frameworks, it has its roots in big agriculture and in colonialism. The victorians could definitely have had this weird obsession with vegetables that look perfect.

But does it really even matter how vegetables look?
