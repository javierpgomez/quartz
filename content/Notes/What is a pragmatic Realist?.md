# What is a pragmatic realist?

## Source:

- Something to do with [[William James]]

## Key ideas

- What does it mean to be a pragmatic realist?
- Meaning I do which produces the best results
	- I do what makes me happy
- This gives me the flexibility to not be attached.
	- I don't have to stick to one thing
- I have values and principles
	- But I'm willing to let go of something if I can feel that it doesn't really make me happy

- Being able to give a bit here and there
	- it's not a never surrender program
- and it's to make me happy.
	- not to change the world naman

## Links to sobriety

- This is the idea with sobriety too
- Where I'm not attached to any one thing
- I'm only willing to do what works

## A related idea

- If this is true, you must try different things
	- The only way this will work. Is if you're willing to try new things.
	- Because you'll otherwise be stuck in a rut.

- It's like when I was banging my head against a religious way of thinking.
	- And that didn't work
- So the ability to let go of an overly religious perspective
	- and to admit that it wasn't helping my sobriety, really was a big step

## Pragmatic Idealist? or Pragmatic Realist?

- Pragmatic idealist is more interesting
	- because this is a bit of a counter intuitive
	- or it cancelled each other out

- Pragmatic Idealism naman is
	- coined by John Dewey
	- and adopted by mahatma ghandi
	- Thus it must be what Martin Luther King Jr. practiced

- it's a bit like utilitarianism
- You have to be willing to compromise somewhat
- you can't be so rigid

- But you still have ideals?

- (I admit I'm probably not getting this 100% right.)
- But still it's a nice little paradox to play around with.
- and that's a fun thing to explore
