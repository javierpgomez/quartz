Traveling, especially when funded by passive income, offers a luxuryâ€”time. However, the concept of "Travel Guilt" can often rob us of genuinely enjoying that luxury. This guilt, this nagging feeling that we should be doing 'everything' because we've invested in getting there, can be counterproductive.

I've found that the best journeys aren't about checking off a list of 'must-dos'. It's about being in the moment, allowing your intuition to guide your footsteps. Wander, explore, and engage with what genuinely catches your eye, not what a guidebook or social expectation demands.

The pressure to "maximize" a trip by visiting every site or tourist attraction stems from the same productivity mindset that we often try to escape when traveling. What's the point of going to every room in the Louvre if you don't genuinely appreciate each piece? Isn't the aim of travel to enrich our lives, rather than to fill them with unchecked boxes?

For me, travel is a form of mindfulness. It's a chance to step out of my daily routines and be completely present in a new context. And it's not about just seeing the world but really experiencing it, absorbing it in its full texture and color. I would rather see fewer things but see them more deeply.

So, the next time you travel, permit yourself the freedom to explore, to miss out, and to truly experience what's in front of you. This is not a race; it's life. Your journey should be measured not by the number of photos or souvenirs but by the enrichment of your own life and perhaps even your soul.
