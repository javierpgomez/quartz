# The Shirky principle

## Source
- [[Notes/Super Thinking (book outline)]]

## Key Idea
- Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution 

- Chiropractors
	- I have a story about how intercare tried to keep me coming back forever. Not exactly the kind of relationship you want to have
- Gyms 
- Want you to keep going to them

## For me
- If you have to coach with me from a long time
- That's not the goal here

- I want to give you the tools to help yourself 
- And then send you on your merry way
