# My writing (250-300 words)

When it comes to building your health, don't forget to factor in hope

For many people it feels a bit like there's no point, and that everything just kinda is the same. So one thing you can do to help build health is to find some hope. You need to feel like there is a chance of getting well and better

And the best place to find hope is in other people

Being with another person can outsource hope

It can also give you reason to keep working out. Sometimes, I don't really feel like taking care of myself, but if I have a motivation from someone else, I do a little bit better. I'm more willing to make sacrifices

Find something to hope in and you can build health from there.
