# My writing (250-300 words)

I mentioned this book in passing before, and I was able to finish reading over the holidays.

The author, Barbara Ehrenreich, is a political scientist who takes her critical eye to the health and wellness industry.

While I don't agree with everything she writes, there are a few quotes from the book that really hit home. For example:

In the health-conscious mind-set that has prevailed among the world’s affluent people for about four decades now, health is indistinguishable from virtue, tasty foods are “sinfully delicious,” while healthful foods may taste good enough to be advertised as “guilt-free.” 

And another:

A middle-aged woman reports that “I keep maniacally active because if there’s any down time I sit there feeling guilty I’m not doing anything.”

Have you ever felt like you're a bad person because of your health?

I've hear it from many people throughout the years:

-   I'm such a failure for breaking my diet
-   I'm just not a disciplined person
-   It's my fault that my health is in bad shape

As humans, we tend to see our health habits, and then equate that to our worth as people.

If I'm able to exercise and eat well- then that means I'm a good person!

But if I skip workouts and binge on food, then I'm no good...

The solution: Cut the cycle of guilt- then take one step in the right direction

Breaking this pattern is not easy. And it takes a lot of practice.

Here are 3 practical ways you can work on this

1.  Aim to not skip twice - it's okay to miss a day, it happens. Just don't skip twice
2.  Affirm yourself when you can - one rough day doesn't make you a bad person
3.  Do the next right thing - If it all feels overwhelming, just focus on one thing at a time
