# My writing (250-300 words)

Here are some very tangible ways to make this work for you (the goal gradient hypothesis)

1. Offer a head start. 

When you're getting started, it can feel like there's a long long way to go. Forget that for a second- focus first instead on putting yourself a little bit ahead.

If you have a headstart, then you already have a bit of momentum, and you're not starting completely from scratch

(one trick as a coach is to reframe things to show how you already do have a headstart!)

2. Track and acknowledge progress. 


When you're stuck in the nitty gritty, it can be hard to imagine that you're making progress and going in the right direction. So every once in a while, you have to track progress and show yourself how you're doing

(I think for my writing, I should track how many words I got done in a day to celebrate)
 
3. Break down milestones. 

If it feels like success is so so far away, then it feels really demotivating (going through this now) But if I can break it down into smaller things, then maybe it can work out better.

Celebrate the small wins and this can feel much more doable
