### Key Idea

But, fashion is art and artists detect trends before everybody else.

If you think fashion and war donâ€™t go together, think again. Already elected officials have gone quiet after suggesting that the solution to the Russian winter is to don more sweaters. It will be interesting to see if sweater-wearing politicians will be allowed onto the floor of the Commons to vote this winter.
