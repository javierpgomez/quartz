The realization that my newborn is instinctively drawn to screens has been a wake-up call for me. It's not just about her; it's about setting the right example and creating a healthier environment for our entire family. The insights from the study on phone usage in social situations underscore this even more. It's intriguing yet concerning how deeply ingrained our screen habits have become, to the point where they hinder real-life interactions.

As the article "New study: A better way to kill time" highlights, our default to phone usage in social settings might not be as beneficial as we assume. The study's findings that people without phones enjoyed their time more, felt more connected, and were ultimately happier, is a powerful testament to the value of human interaction over digital distraction. This aligns with my observations and concerns about how screen time impacts not only my behavior but also my child's development.

Therefore, I'm committing to being more intentional about my screen use. It's not just about reducing screen time; it's about understanding the impact of these devices on our lives and relationships. For my daughter's sake and my own well-being, I'm exploring ways to engage more with the world around me and less with the digital one. This includes setting specific 'phone-free' times and spaces, encouraging more face-to-face interactions, and actively choosing to engage with my surroundings.

This article serves as a reminder of the subtle yet profound effects our everyday choices have on our well-being and relationships. It's a call to action for me, as a parent and an individual, to reassess and realign my habits towards a more connected, present, and fulfilling life.
