### Key Idea

Rituals are able to control energy. And so they are useful for envy, anger, hatred and all these things.

I do think we need more rituals. Not just for forgiveness but for lots of things – including fighting! We have to get smarter about how we fight. That means noticing the tripwires that lead to malignant conflict — like humiliation, conflict entrepreneurs, and binary group identities.
