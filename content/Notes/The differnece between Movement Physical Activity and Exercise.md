Movement is a very broad term that can encompass a lot of different activities. 

Physical activity is the middle ground between movements that are purely for recreation and those that are necessary for daily living. It can be anything from going for a walk to playing a sport to doing chores around the house.

Exercise is a subcategory of physical activity. It is any activity that is done with the intention of improving physical fitness. This can include activities like running, weightlifting, and playing organized sports.

All exercise is physical activity, but not all physical activity is exercise. For example, walking to the store is physical activity, but it is not typically done with the intention of improving physical fitness. It is important to remember that even small amounts of physical activity can have benefits for your health.
