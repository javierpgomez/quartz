As a health coach who thrives on the trails, I've always known hiking to be a multifaceted exercise, but it's illuminating to discover the science that stepping down poses more risk than stepping up. The act of descending requires our muscles to engage in a decelerative, braking action, which is inherently more challenging and injury-prone than the propulsive motion of climbing. This explains why walking downhill feels more strenuousâ€”it's not just a sensation; it's a physical reality demanding greater control.

The thrill of hiking isn't just in the ascent; I relish the descent as well because it tests my body's ability to handle these braking forces. And isn't that a metaphor for life? We climb, we reach peaks, and then we must carefully navigate back down. It's a cycle that keeps us resilient.

Incorporating exercises like broad jumps into my routine is not only a dynamic way to gauge the power in my legs but also to ensure they're prepared for the rigors of both the upward strides and the cautious steps back down the mountain.
