Illeism, the practice of referring to oneself in the third person, is more than a rhetorical flourish used by politicians and historical figures. It's a cognitive tool that can help us gain a more objective perspective on our own problems. Think of it as a mental "zoom out" button, allowing us to see the forest for the trees.

Studies suggest that employing illeism can lead to greater intellectual humility, an increased capacity to recognize others' perspectives, and a willingness to compromise. These are all markers of wise reasoning. For someone like me, who often finds himself wrestling with challenges and seeking support, this is a game-changer.

The beauty of illeism lies in its simplicity. A small linguistic switch can lead to a profound shift in mindset. It's akin to changing the camera angle in a film to reveal elements that were previously hidden.

In a world where we're often too caught up in our own narratives, illeism offers a way to step back and view our lives as if we were impartial observers. This can be especially useful when navigating complex decisions or emotional situations.
