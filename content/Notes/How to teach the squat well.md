### Key Idea

It wasn't until I started strength training myself that I realized how little I actually knew about how to properly teach the squat. I always assumed that because I was able to do the movement myself, I could easily teach it to others. However, I quickly realized that there is a lot more to squatting than just lowering yourself down and then standing back up.

If they didn't have natural fitness ability, I got completely lost
