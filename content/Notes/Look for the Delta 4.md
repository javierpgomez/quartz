### Key Idea

Look for the delta 4
Something becomes so convenience

High tolerance
Because of how efficient it is

method was, most people would say maybe this is 78 on 10, that is maybe two on 10, 1 on 10, 3 and 10. So the framework is very simple that every time the delta of efficiency score is greater than equal to four, three things happen. It's an irreversible behavior. Once you experience a delta for product or service, you cannot go back. There is obviously very, very high tolerance. That's the second thing that you will hate Uber, but you're not going to like damn it, I'm going to delete this happened. I'm gonna move to a more inefficient behavior. The third thing is what I call it, the UBp unique brag worthy proposition humans when they discover something Delta for

when human discover a delta 4, they can't stop talking about it
