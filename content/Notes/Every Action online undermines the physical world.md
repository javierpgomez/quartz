This idea is so powerful to me.

I find that we live in this false assumption that the internet is infinite

But when we take our lives online, we cannot deny that there are real world effects and exchanges that take place. Most people probably think of this in terms of business. But I think of it in terms of movement.

When you take things online, turns out you move a little bit less by default

When you order that delivery, you're going to move a little bit that day. When you let your robot vacuum do you chores, you move a little bit less that day. You're exchanging movement for time, and little by little that adds up
