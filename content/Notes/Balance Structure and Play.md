When it comes to movement there are actually two ways to approach it!

Some people do better with structure. They like reps and sets. They like to know exactly how many minutes they have to do the movements. Other people do better with freedom. They prefer to move with freedom for a set amount of time and explore all these different possibilities

Ask yourself? Are you a structure person or are you a freedom person? What do you do better in?
