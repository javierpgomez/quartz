When I used to teach, it would take me hours and hours to prepare. Because I was always preparing for every inevitability.

That's what the best performers were doing.

That's because almost nothing goes precisely according to plan, or schedule, and — Sod’s Law — the more important the conference or interview, the more likely that is to be true.

Or, at least it can feel that way, so better to be prepared, and flexible.

This is what pros can do. They are able to improvise and adapt. They can be creative. See also [Freedom is just being yourself (concept)](Notes/Freedom%20is%20just%20being%20yourself%20(concept).md)
