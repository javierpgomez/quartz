### Key Idea

Moral cohesion is really powerful
It's probably more important that economic incentives

So it's like a cult to me
You're more likely to stay together if you have a moral casue to

the unavoidable moral ingredient required for any successful new community. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522307276/20088737))
