There are so many things you will encounter in your life. And ask yourself, **how prepared are you to approach and deal with them?**

This means you don't just have to have the skills (the easy part)
This means you have to have a healthy body (which everyone sacrifices)
But you also need to have
- self-awareness
- focus
- emotional processing
- the ability to communicate well
- learning ability
- problem solving
- creativity
The list goes on and on.


That reminds me of [Mental Fitness is on the Rise](Notes/Mental%20Fitness%20is%20on%20the%20Rise.md)
