### Key Idea

And the way the quote I heard was that yes, startups fail, but entrepreneurs don't, what that means is that if you look at any great entrepreneur, any entrepreneur who sticks with it,

There's that quote that most startups fail
but entreprenuers do not fail (because you stick to it long enough)

So if you're playing the long game
You cannot fail
