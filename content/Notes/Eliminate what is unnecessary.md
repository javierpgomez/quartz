### Key Idea

“Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is eliminate the task. Downsize. The rooms you don't have, don't need to be cleaned. Donate. The items you don't own, don't need to be organized. Delete. The projects you don't take on, don't need to be finished. Is this a problem that needs to be solved? Or is it a problem that can be eliminated all together?”
