**The Urgency of Engagement**

We've all been in meetings, presentations, or sales pitches where the speaker drones on with backstory or context, only to reach the main point long after we've lost interest. But what if the story started with the most critical or exciting moment? The principle of "starting your story right before you get eaten by the bear" asserts that people are most engaged when they're immediately presented with something compelling.

**Making Storytelling Powerful**

To make your storytelling more impactful, the idea is to cut the fluff and get to the point that holds the audience's attention. It's about identifying the "bear" in your narrative—the moment of crisis or opportunity—and beginning your story just before that. This method works in various contexts: Q&A sessions, pitches, team meetings, and even sales conversations. I find this approach extremely effective, as it quickly captures attention and sustains interest.

**Applicability in Different Contexts**

Whether you're presenting a business proposal or sharing an anecdote in a casual conversation, this concept applies. When you make the main point or action the focal point of your narrative, you immediately grab your listeners' attention, allowing for a more compelling and memorable story.

**Why This Matters**

I've seen firsthand the dramatic difference this makes in engagement. When you start at the point of highest interest, the chances are much higher that your audience will stay engaged until the end. This isn't just a tactic; it's a philosophy of communication that prioritizes the listener's engagement and curiosity.

**Key Takeaway**

Craft your narrative in a way that starts with the most critical moment—essentially, right before you would metaphorically get "eaten by the bear." It creates a sense of urgency and importance, ensuring that your message is not just heard, but also felt and remembered.
