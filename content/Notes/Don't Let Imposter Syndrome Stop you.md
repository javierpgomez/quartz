I want to be a really powerful and successful health coach, but I'm not a doctor, a nutritionist or a physical therapist.

And that makes me pause.
"Am I qualified to do this?"
"Am I the best person to help people make these changes"

But I saw this paragraph from [Jon Goodman](https://www.instagram.com/itscoachgoodman/)

>Don’t let your perceived inexperience or perceived inadequacy related to your peers stop you. Your client doesn’t need your advanced knowledge. Odds are they already know what they should be doing.  
  
>Your success as a coach depends on how good you are at getting them to do what they already know they should do.

And I know I can help people make change!

I am a good listener and a good coach. 
And if someone has the objections above, then they may not be the best fit for me.
