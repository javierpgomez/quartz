# Self handicap and play

When we're playing, there's an element of self handicap that's going on.
So we're not pushing ourselves to the limit
That happens more in the context of competetion
Where I'm trying to destroy my opponennt and the group
(even my teammates-- think about how if I'm so competitive I can even harm my teammates)

## New ways to move

Why self handicap?
From a self perspective
It's so that you can learn to do something different
Like what if I didn't use my palms?
Or what if I did this or that

Giving yourself restrictions is a kind of play
(Princess Bride fighting with your off hand)
Enjoying yourself
It's not about winning outright
It's more about having a good time for yourself

## From a social perspective

When you play with other people
there's also this element of self handicapping
Where you actually play at a lower skill level
in order to keep the game going.

I think of how I used to play with a large group of friends at different skills levels
and I wouldn't compete at my hardest
and I would get upset with Rafa who would compete as hard as he could
Which is not the point for me.

So you play at a weaker level, not so much to suck on purpose
but to maintain social relationships

and that's fine
That's part of it also

## What is play for?

Because play is not just about self fulfillment
it's also about maintaining relationships
understsanding how we work together

The social element of play

I think about how working out in groups is so much fun
and we copy one another
and play together
so that we can have strong social relationships

## How can I self handicap better?

I think about how I don't self handicap very well
People still perceive me as very smart or clever
or someone who's ahead of them and not behind them or with them
