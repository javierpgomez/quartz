### Key Idea

At the root of taking care of health can be fear

Fear of aging. Fear of sickness. Fear of death. This list goes on and on. And we can try to alleviate this fear with different things that make us feel safe and secure. Money is one way of doing that. If I have enough money, then I feel like I don't need to worry about whatever health issues come my way

But there are other ways of feeling secure

--

What if you can address the fear directly?

By going into the fear itself- whether by meditation. Or by prayer. Or going into that space where you can admit to yourself what it is you are afraid of, then you'll be able to meet it there. If you are not afraid of sickness, death, or old age, then you won't get trapped in anxiety

Surprise surprise things will start to feel better
