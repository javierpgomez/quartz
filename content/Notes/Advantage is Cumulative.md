# Advantage is cumulative

## Context

This phrase was in the crisis of meritocracy article in the LRB
I like this article because it really articulates well a lot about how I feel regarding the advantages provided by privilege

## What is it

It's just the idea that when you have advantages, you are in a position to preserve those advantage. And so you can continue to reap the benefits of those advantages.

## Other Ideas

This reminds me of the 
[[Matthew Principle]]
from 
[[Notes/War and Peace and War]]

[[Notes/Compounding effect]]
