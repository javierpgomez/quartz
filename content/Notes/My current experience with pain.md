### Key Idea

**

There’s a growing group of people who really have no fitness habits

They are completely true beginners

  

[Last week,](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/9dO1q7_H_?languageTag=en#/main) I mentioned that there are some people who don’t really enjoy exercise

  

And the trick I’m looking for here is how to help those people out somehow

  
  

To be honest with you, ever since I’ve had pain issues, workout hasn’t been so enjoyable

  

I’m constantly reminding myself to take care of my health and think of things in the long game.

  

But it’s been much harder to motivate myself to workout compared to whenI was progressing fast and doing things that felt fun and interesting

  

For the first time, I think I understand the problem of people who don’t find exercise to be the most accessible or enjoyable thing in the world.
