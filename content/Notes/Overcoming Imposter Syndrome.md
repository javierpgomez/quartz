Seth Godin's ideas on being an imposter

>"You feel that way because you are an imposter. And so am I. Because if you are doing work that hasn't been done before, you can't be sure it's going to work. Because it's never been done."

I love this because it's easy to feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. And that everyone else knows what is going on.

But! If I'm being myself, and working authentically, then I'm doing something that has never been done before.

In fact, because of my unique history, story, and learnings, I can say that I have a unique responsibility to share my ideas and thoughts with the world!
