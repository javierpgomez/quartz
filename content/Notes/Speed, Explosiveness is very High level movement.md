## Highlights (Key Ideas)
- Dan John has this quote: "Don't add speed on top of dysfunction"
	- It's a recipe for pain and injury
- Another way of looking at this, is that everyone wants to do the speed progression
	- That's the fun part that looks cool
	- But very few of us will actually perform here.
	- This is world class level
