Embarking on a hike isn’t merely a day's affair; it's a commitment that begins much earlier than I ever anticipated. An article titled "3 Musts Before Hiking" opened my eyes to a nuance I’d overlooked—the necessity of pre-hydration. It's not just about the water you carry; it's about the hydration you build up days in advance. It seems the journey to the peak starts with a glass of water in hand, long before the trailhead is in sight.

Studies are emphatic on this: Dehydration is a stealthy saboteur of vigor. Begin hydrating a day or two ahead, allowing water to become your preliminary trail companion, not merely a checkpoint necessity. And alcohol? It’s a false friend when peaks are on the horizon. Who knew that the real trek began with foresight and a filled water bottle at home?

This preparation isn't a cumbersome chore; it's an act of respect for the body’s needs and the challenges it will face. I've learned that the conquest of a summit is not a spontaneous sprint but a deliberate march, starting with the very molecules that sustain us.
