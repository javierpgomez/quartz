### Highlights
Just rubs me the wrong way a bit
I don't know if I'm just being racist
And I can't stand the low key christian thing

I was so nervous and anxious last night
Honestly I wasn't sure if I'm ready for this

**I don't really know you that well**
**We have just met and it seems very quick to go into a partnership right away**

Just from Twitter
And I don't know your values and the way you work at all

**What are you career goals?**
What are you trying to do?
How do you see yourself working?

But when I think about my own work
**I've been working on FitforLife for a long time
And it feels so attached to me**
I'm not ready to partner up yet

But when it comes to the FFL system
**I want to continue to work on it**

on my own for now

If you still want to participate
you can think of yourself as a community manager

I think I want more to for myself as a creator
and maybe if the opportunity is still there we can partner up

And if you still want to help out
I can give you a comission per referal

And I'm so happy for your health progress
and the mindset you've been able to build for yourself

**There's a build in public story here**
This is one of those stories where when you get what you want
It turns out it might not have been what you wanted 
I thought I wanted to work with partners


### **Maybe not this stuff na**
**What's this to you?**
- for me it's a full time job
- I need to make this my full time job
- Funnel is to get 1 on 1 coaching also
- this is my all in
- Where I can pull in $4000 a month

**What do you expect to get out of this financially?**
- Because that shows your commitment

**Focus on building the circle**
**Content expert is me**
**Community is John**

**The current voice is still too much in the coaches' voice**
- Adding some value
- Figuring out the value of the learning
- Figuring out the language of the learner

Yes there's a coach
and there's a real life person who's also on the journey

From the perspective of being relatable
Someone who is also on the way of the journey

**The peers are important**
- Dickie is just 2 years in
and Cole has been in it for about 
- 10 years

**So there's that good combination**
- there's a context expert
and then there's an experience

---

**Why is this really important?**
- so your motivation is about being present with you're with your family

Dance with my daughter at her wedding

What's your why and then identify your goals
- it's a chance to uncomplicate your goals
Then the goals become:

When you're 90 or you're 35
- Move more, and eat right
- Keep moving
- and eat right
These things still matter

**Activities can change**

----

**Cutting back the feedback loop much more quickly**
- prepare & plan
- run & (take action)
- rest & recover (don't burn yourself out)
- record

**That's a good framework**

Calorie counting
is not for you

Simplicity is to eliminate friction

Your default is this thing
Your lifestyle resets your default

**But those are already my ideas! So it's not like he's bringing anything new to the table**
