# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

I'm 30 and what am I doing to 40 an easier way to do it is say, what do I need to be doing when I'm 100 and then how do I work backwards from that? And so for me as a ripe old, 46 year old, 45 year old, when I started thinking about this, the the question was, okay, well, if I want to live to 100

Backcast from what you want to do when you're old
and then send it back
and figure out what you need to do
