### Key Idea

Hypothalamus measure leptin
it's like a thermostate

Let's go a little bit further. You referred to the Lippestad, so say a little bit more about what we've learned about this Lippestad and what's circulating factors might play a role in governing this and what's been learned through some of the work that was done using para bio sis Speaker 1: I'm going to give you the simple version. There is a more complex version that is emerging but I'll start with the simple version which is that it is a negative feedback system similar to your home thermostat, similar to the thermostat in your brain, in that the hypothalamus measures levels of a circulating hormone called leptin that circulates in proportion to your body fat mass. So the same way your home thermostat measures the
