# Grey Water (idea)

This is water that has been washed with
Shower, sinks, kitchen sinks

The question is what kind of soaps and chemicals can I use so that it's okay

## Kitchen Sink
Washing dishes
Mostly food type wastes

## Shower
Shampoos and soaps

## Bathroom Sink
Toothpaste and mouthwash mostly

## Laundry
Detergent

## Backup system
And there needs to be a system so that it can be diverted.
For example when I clean the bathroom
I might have to use bleach kasi
Unless you have some powerful cleaners that don't use bleach.
