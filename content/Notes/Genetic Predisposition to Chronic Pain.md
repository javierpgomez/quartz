### Key Ideas

The fact that you can be genetically predisposed to chronic pain can be a difficult reality to accept. It can feel like something that is completely out of your control, and that can be frustrating and overwhelming. 

Research has shown that certain genes can make some people more susceptible to chronic pain, which can make it a more persistent and severe problem for them. However, it's important to note that while these genetic predispositions may play a role in chronic pain, they do not necessarily determine whether or not a person will experience it. 

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that while researchers have been able to identify genes that predispose people to chronic pain, they have not yet found any genes that increase the risk for acute back pain. 

This suggests that the causes of acute back pain may be different from those of chronic pain and may be related more to lifestyle and environmental factors.

That's interesting because chronic pain is so misunderstood and it's hard to decide the best way to navigate it

That reminds me that I can't always control everything. If I'm predisposed to chronic pain I have to accept that part of it. This note is also related to [[Notes/To Predict Chronic Pain Look at the Brain]]

It's similar because because there's so much we have yet to understand. But we know that we can reduce pain by [[Notes/Move more to reduce pain]]

It's different because we always have to balance this with true and proper healthcare [[Notes/How to balance measureables and actual healthcare]]

It's important because we want to help people live better lives
