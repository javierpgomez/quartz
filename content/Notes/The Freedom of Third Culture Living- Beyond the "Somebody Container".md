When we explore the vast terrains of travel and living abroad, we often end up on an unforeseen journey of self-discovery. It's not the physical borders that we cross but the internal boundaries—constrained by societal norms, familial expectations, and self-imposed limitations—that truly expand. The article "On Travel, Living Abroad & Losing Your Self" paints an intriguing notion about third culture adults. What struck me is that these individuals have "disconnected from their own default paths" and exist in a state of "lack of legibility."

I'm nodding my head vigorously as I read this. I've always felt that I'm a bit of a cultural hybrid, zigzagging between worlds and not fully belonging to any. There's freedom in such an existence. Third culture adults are like will-o'-the-wisps, illuminating paths not typically seen, existing in the murky territories between societal containers. No, we aren't this or that, but an amalgamation of experiences, thoughts, and contradictions.

Remember those puzzling questions like, "What's bad about changing?" and "What's good about not changing?" from earlier musings? They fit like a glove here. Third culture living is a conscious choice to step away from dichotomous thinking. We don't neatly fit into societal "somebody containers," and why should we? Those containers limit perspective, confine growth, and let's be honest, they are boring! We'd rather be a multitude, a labyrinth of experiences and thoughts.

The beauty is in giving others the space to be confusing, to be a myriad of things without needing to "understand" them in the traditional sense. That's like choosing to enjoy a complex piece of art without needing to dissect every brush stroke. You appreciate it for what it is—a confluence of contradictions, a palette of emotions, and an ever-changing spectacle.

And there's a certain resonance with the idea of hormesis here: a bit of stress, a bit of dissonance, a bit of contradiction—all these make us more resilient and open-minded. I find it exhilarating to be part of a community that not only accepts but celebrates these facets. We're not "nobody"; we're "everybody" and "somebody" all at once.
