## **1. Get started with these prompts**

Here are some prompts to help you get started identifying your own favorite problems:

-   What were you obsessed with as a child or teenager? (Ask your parents or caregivers)
-   What are the longest running hobbies you’ve had in your life?
-   What common themes or patterns do you notice emerging in your life repeatedly?
-   What kinds of stories, art, or music give you goosebumps, make your hair stand up, or move you to tears?
-   What pursuits that others consider challenging do you find fun and engaging?
-   What do you find your mind wandering to in the in-between moments of your day?
-   If you could wave a magic wand and have the ultimate answer to any question, what question would it be?
-   If you could travel to the future and ask your future self anything, what would it be? What would you ask your past self?
-   If you read all the books and took all the courses you wanted to, what question would you like to have answered after all that?
-   What are your most pressing problems currently?

## **2. Formulate your own “How/What” questions**

Once you have an idea of your long-term interests, I recommend phrasing them as questions that begin with “How…” and “What…” Such questions can’t be answered with a simple yes or no – they invite more subtle, complex answers based on deeper reflection:

-   How can I…?
-   How might we…?
-   How can my team/organization…?
-   How can I help others to…?
-   How does X relate to Y?
-   How do I…?
-   What does it look like to…?
-   What would be possible if…?
-   What do I want with…?
-   What would I do if…?
-   What would happen if…?
-   What would have to be true to…?

## **3. Make your questions specific, counter-intuitive, or cross-disciplinary**

Here are some guidelines to help you come up with the most direct, impactful questions possible:

1.  Make them specific
2.  Make them counter-intuitive
3.  Make them cross-disciplinary
