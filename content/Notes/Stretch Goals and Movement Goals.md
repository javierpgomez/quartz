###   
Stretch Goals and Movement Goals by Kelly McGonigal

This week, I've been doing some listening to the ideas of Dr. Kelly McGonigal.

She has a book called "The Joy of Movement" and it sounds like it would be right up my alley.

Until I can get to reading that in the meantime, I want to [share something interesting that she mentioned on a podcast](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/30Nn0RuGy/c?w=ak772ba1Gie-1LdWkZsO99Ej8UhxiIEXY8WsHpJlBHI.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9KY2xROEx6bG9sOD90PTM2NTkiLCJyIjoiZjAyODFmZjctZTI2ZS00YTMxLTMzNWUtMGZhMDFiOTFkZDY5IiwibSI6ImxwIn0): The difference between "Stretch Goals" and "Movement Goals"

### Stretch Goals are ideas that intrigue us

Think about how it's nice to imagine these:

-   "Could I run a marathon?"
-   "Could I lose 20 pounds?"
-   "Can I earning a new skill at my age?"

We all think- and there's nothing wrong with that.

It says something about your desires.

It gives you a vision.

It can motivate you.

### Movement Goals are the small steps

Now, each stretch goal can be broken in to movement goals

-   Running a marathon becomes "doing my morning run"
-   Losing 20 pounds becomes "taking the stairs when I can"
-   Learning a new skill becomes "spending time with a teacher"

This is the key bit

### Learn to reframe you stretch goals into movement goals

That way even if you're not close to hitting your stretch goals, you can keep yourself going by focusing on your movement goals instead

Your Stretch goals give you your "WHY"

Your Movements goals focus on the "HOW"
