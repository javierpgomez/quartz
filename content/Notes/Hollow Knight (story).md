# Hollow Knight (story)

## Key idea
- Hollow Knight is an amazing game that's all about exploration and free play.
- The way the game limits where you can is with your skills
	- Those let you access certain areas that were previously unavailable to you.
- And the design is also that you can see there's something there to acess
	- But you're not able to get to it just yet until you have the skills
