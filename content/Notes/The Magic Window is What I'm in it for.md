_“There’s a magical window – 8 to 12 years – during which you and your wife are their **absolute favorite people in the world**. They wait by the door for you to come home like a puppy. There’s no one on earth they’d rather be with. **And then it’s gone.** Now it doesn’t mean that they don’t love you as much. They still need you just as much. But the magical window is gone.”_
