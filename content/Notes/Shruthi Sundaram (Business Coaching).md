Ideal customer avatar

Working with people with physical injuries is a bit of a niche

Getting medical results back is a different niche
- Blood results;
- Doctor's diagnosis

Niching down
- I'm there at the third part
- After you've seen a doctor
- And you've done some physical therapy

Stick to an avatar for about 3 months
- How do I feel in this niche?
- Do I feel like I'm making progress
- 60% of figuring out what we do is how I feel about
- The 40% is the feedback from other people

Point A to Point B
- at a particular place
Point A - Done with injury, physiotherapy, and such
Point B - Going back to the lifestyle before injury - point B - going back to the lifestyle before injury
-- The Point B is a mental aspect - Restarting 
- Do not feel afraid, do not feel uncertain, go back to the lifestyle you used to live
- Is diet and health part of it
- Is mindset shift part of it
- Minimizing the chances of it happening again

People who had single injuries
Doing the things they love to do
Have gone to the doctor
have seen physical therapists
Still feel like they're stuck and afriad
So I'll help them feel less afraid
Bring their bodies back to what it used to be
And help prevent it from happening again
So that they can go back to doing the things they love

i.e. BUILD A STANDARD TEMPLATE of what the COACHING LOOKS LIKE

How does prevention, mindset, diet look like
- Make it more concrete
- Make it specific
- How many calls
- Where are you in your mindset journey?
- What are you current habits?
- What habits do they need to build?
Getting into the nitty gritty as much as possible as to what works
