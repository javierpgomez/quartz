# Injury can encourage exploration

## Source:
- ??

## Key Idea

- Sooner or later, you're probably going to get injured

- When you're injured
- There's the temptation to stop
- And rest if it's serious

- But also take it a chance to explore safely
- Don't do nothing because
- Blood flow helps

- Have the mental flexibility to adapt
- Try taking a different path instead.
- When things don't happen as you plan

### How would I implement it

- Can I stay true to my deep goal
- But still be flexible and creative
