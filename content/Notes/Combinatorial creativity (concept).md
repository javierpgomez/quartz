What is this? Where did I see this? 

Ah it's that nothing is really original.

Brainpickings mentions this.

I think it's from that David Perel Video

## Example

Perel uses Noah Chomsky's book Sapiens
I can use the idea of bending blending and breaking for TOK

# Creativity is combinatorial 

Breaking blending bending
This was from that talk right?
