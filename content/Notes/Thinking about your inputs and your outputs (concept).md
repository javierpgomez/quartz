# Thinking about your inputs and outputs (concept)

## Analogy for this
[[Notes/Jiro dreams of sushi (Raw Materials story)]]

## What are you inputs
There's your personal consumption
- These are your inputs
- whether you like it or not
- it's your raw materials

## What are your outputs
Then there's your personal production 
- Those inputs will basically be what you're thoughts are about

## What you make depends on what you consume
