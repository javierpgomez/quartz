**Interestingly, according to the current theory of evolution, mushrooms represent a higher form of life than the animal kingdom, to which we belong. And above the fungi are the plants. So in a way, mushrooms are smarter than us, although thatâ€™s not easy for us to accept.**

That's interesting because we tend to think of ourselves as the highest and strongest lifeform. And so having fungi be the highest life form.

That reminds me [The world is too similar because of the scale](Notes/The%20world%20is%20too%20similar%20because%20of%20the%20scale.md). Our interconnectedness makes the world start to seem more similar than different. Of course we have different cultures and beliefs. 

Because we're so powerfully connected, there's so much going on. And we are so connected to the world. What we do affects everyone in some way- we are so powerfully connected that we have to respect that

It's similar because we are all deeply connected, culture is so the same now

It's different because this can be a bad thing. It becomes so homogenous

It's important because this is the world now. It's an interconnected powerful world
