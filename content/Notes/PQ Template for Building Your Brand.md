Who I am, and why I want to help you succeed

I am a business consultant and personal coach who writes, coaches, and leads workshops to help ambitious individuals, employees, and entrepreneurs achieve their full potential in their professional and personal lives.

Having built my career in beauty and luxury marketing, I initially left my role at multinational Procter & Gamble to start up my own company, providing digital marketing consulting to brands like Burberry and Vertu. I have since continued to write, consult and train businesses to help integrate digital in their strategies and toolkits, from large corporations down to startups and solopreneuers

Today, I help people reach their fullest potential and maximize their personal and professional impact by setting clear objectives, balancing their ambitions at work with their personal priorities, and managing their time and energy effectively. Ultimately, I want people to achieve their wildest dreams and their most audacious goals!
