# Chronic Pain

According to the [[Podcast With Dr. Melissa Farmer on Pain and Emotional Learning]]

Acute pain and chronic pain are processed in different parts of the brain.
Acute pain is processed in the sensory part.
Then chornic pain is processed in the emotional part of the brain, in the amygdala

This means that it's linked to the emotional part of the brain.
Therefore it can be triggered by emotions like fear, anxiety, worry
These sorts of negative emotions

What really struck me is how chronic pain is processed in a different part of the brain
It's around the 38 minute mark
