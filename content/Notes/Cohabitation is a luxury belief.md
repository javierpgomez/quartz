# Idea Name

### Context / Source

Rob Henderson's stuff
I like him because he's a smart conservative

### Key Idea

The idea that cohabiting partnerships are good is a luxury belief
Because if you you money, the problems that come with a cohabiting partnership not working out are less detrimental

But when people without money try to do this it doesn't really work out as well for them
