# Transplanting Shock

- If you transplant a plant when it can't handle it, it may struggle to thrive.
- It needs to stay hyrdrated so that the roots don't dry out

In temperate climates, the suggestion is to transplant it when the plant is dormant 
(so like winter)
But that doesn't really apply to the Philippines

So when to transplant plants in tropical climates?
- I can't find good research

If the roots shouldn't dry out, then I guess rainy season would be a good time to do it
