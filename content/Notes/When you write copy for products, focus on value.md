# When you write copy for products, focus on value

## Key Ideas

- As creators we focus on features of our product
- But customers care about value
- So you need to be able to map your features, to their benefits, to their value

- As an example:
	- "This camera has a 15 megapixel camera" (that's a feature)
	- "It can take sharp photo images" (that's a benefit)
	- "Imaged can be zoomed in or printed in large format and still look sharp" (that's the value)
