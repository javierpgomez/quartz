Good question -- I would say my biggest health challenge right now is prioritization or balancing my health goals with mental stress (from work mostly). I've always liked sports and exercising. I try to run or work out 3-5x a week, but it's really hard to get myself to do it sometimes because my mind is stressed about some other things.
