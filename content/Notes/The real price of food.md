### Key Idea

These “hidden costs” have been estimated at almost US$20 trillion (£16.3 trillion) per year. Put simply, the prices we pay for food today do not reflect the true cost of producing it – and such a system is unsustainable.

Food is cheap but there are hidden costs that are not actually baked into the price
