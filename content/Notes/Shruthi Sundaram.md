Value ladder
leading up to the 
1 to 1 coaching

Profile
- Going through the assets and figuring out what it's purpose is
- customer avatar and profile
- This guy is different and helping
(Targetting more the pain points of the customers)

Assume the lifelong health thing is already a given

"I help people who don't like exercise"
"I help people who are tired"

Tweet
--> If you're tired of hacks; 
If you're tired of yo-yo diets, if you're tired of get fit quick things.
--> 

Getting people out of Twitter and getting into an email list of some sort

Sign up for the newsletter is a stronger CTA than following me on Twitter

- Write about your health community and pin that tweet

Revue newsletter

- Risky because you don't know the quality of the newsletter
- So it's good to just be able to read

Value Based Pricing
- Write down everything that is valuable
- What is all the materials
- How much is that thing worth?
- Putting a clear value on each of the items and then putting 

Communiting value online also
- In terms of pricing
- Testimonials and getting people's reactions to the program online
- Lack of confidence and imposter syndrome

Getting to talk to people and get in and show that they can help you

Friends are people that I like
- Corporate instead of people I like to work with
- Back my mind
I can provide you with long term value
- then I'll make a proposal
- Then it's a professional relationship
Me helping you out,
and valueing the help enough to ask for a payment

Need more formal structures for getting feedback
- How happy are you with what our current setup is?

Because you're playing the long game
- it's okay to do business with your friends
- Because you're not going to burn bridges

Haven't put myself out there enough

Confused what you're signing up for 
- Because the community didn't exist also
