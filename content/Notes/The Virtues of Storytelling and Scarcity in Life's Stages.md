Everyone acknowledges that fear and greed are universal emotions. This is an enlightening perspective when you think about the stories we tell and how they shape us. Take Richard Feynman, for example. He understood that stories live on, granting us a form of immortality. When I recount stories from my clients' lives, it's not just a coaching session—it's also an archive of meaningful human experiences.

David Brooks’ idea of "resume virtues" vs "eulogy virtues" adds another layer to this. It begs us to question what really counts in life. Resume virtues are for the now, the accomplishments that get you ahead. But eulogy virtues are for forever, the qualities people remember you by. It’s a humbling reminder that long-term legacy outshines short-term achievements.

The career advice to "wave your arms and be noticed" early on makes sense. That's the stage of life where you're trying to carve out a space for yourself. But as you transition into later stages, the tables turn. What becomes most valuable is scarcity—your unique skill set, the stories only you can tell, the wisdom that comes from years of experience.

This entire discussion makes me think about the different seasons of life. We're always so focused on the "now," but perhaps we need to adopt a more holistic view. What stories are we telling now that will live on after us? And are we laying the groundwork for those deeply personal "eulogy virtues"?
