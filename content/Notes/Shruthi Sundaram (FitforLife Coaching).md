W11-12 Saving your insights and planning ahead
Knowledge: You will benefit over time as you collect insights about health
Skill: Recording what you learn in a place that you can review

Collecting insights so that you can look back
How to do this?

Suggestions
- Journaling
- Taking notes
A way to look back on your notes

--

Bringing awareness to the mood: 
- At a point where she wants to improve
- Don't want to feel like she doesn't like herself
- Use my impulse

Felt stuck about 2 weeks back

Weight hasn't changed

Intensity of body of pains have reduced
- stress
Used to look soggy
- Now it's tightened up a bit

Diet
- being more conscious
- Healthy food ; 
- Drinking a lot more water now

Building up awareness and building up an experimental mindset

Deep breathing to help with your overwhelm

How would you set up a system for doing an experiment
- Just messaging someone has been really helpful
- Shared google calendar - have that accountability
- Having someone to help see and manage your energy

Spending a couple of days journaling and digging into your why
- Having pages in front of you?
- Really taps into the awareness and builds that other system

You already do some of this implicitly,
Just bringing it to your awareness and then spelling it out

Thoughts on social support system:

Decathlon cycling group

Husband ? Maybe not

Problem with social support system

Random ideas:
- There are all sorts of clubs
- Lots is happening / Workshops and clubs etc 

Try a club
Try something new
Go out of the house

That's exciting!

Shruthi:

Not really been exercising
Lost weight when we are exercising
Lost weight and then gained weight

Husband got sick
Got the peroid

Not focused and getting back on that 

Overall feels calm:
- frustrated

So there's a thing called book my show
