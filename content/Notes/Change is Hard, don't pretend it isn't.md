The truth is, change IS hard.

And when a coach says that it's not, that can increase the resistance of a client and make them less likely to change. So even though you want them to make it feel possible to them, you still want to honor how challenging this experience is.

Here are two counterintuitive questions I like to ask:
- What would be BAD about changing?
- What is GOOD about NOT changing?

Because change is not 100% good. There are good reasons for your body and your mind to resist the change

That reminds me that [Why we always resist change](Notes/Why%20we%20always%20resist%20change.md). And for good reason. It's so that the brain can be more efficient and take shortcuts.

It's important because if you understand what your brain is doing, then you can understand why you resist change so much!
