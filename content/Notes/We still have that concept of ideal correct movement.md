# My writing (250-300 words)

We still have this old idea that movement and our bodies are like cars and machines. That if there is pain it's because something is out of alignment or something is out of place. 

But the truth is that there's so much variation in the human body that it really is not just that simple, there's so much more to it.

The fact is that there's no one correct way to do it all the time.

It's a model that outdated.
