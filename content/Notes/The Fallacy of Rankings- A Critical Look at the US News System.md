We live in a world obsessed with rankings—whether it's universities, restaurants, or fitness programs. The case of US News rankings exemplifies how these numbers can dominate the public conversation and shape individual decisions. The problem? These rankings can be incredibly misleading and easily manipulated. Just look at the case of Columbia University. After the Thaddeus exposé came to light, their rankings plummeted. But what does that actually mean for the institution or its students?

As someone who's all too familiar with the pitfalls of obsessing over metrics in my coaching business, I understand the inherent flaws in such ranking systems. They offer a simplified representation of what's actually a complex set of variables. You can game the system, make yourself or your organization look good on paper, but at what cost? Just like in health and fitness, there are no shortcuts to excellence.

The public's fixation on these numbers, fueled by posts and tweets that go viral, perpetuates a cycle of misinformation. For instance, when medical schools started pulling away from the US rankings, it was celebrated as if a grand illusion had been dispelled. Yet, the obsession persists. The paradox is that while many decry these rankings, we're also the ones responsible for their prominence. Whether it's colleges or any other institution, the critical question should be, "Are we measuring what actually matters?"

The true absurdity of this situation is that we let numbers dictate how we feel about an entire establishment. I'm a proponent of metrics, but let's use them wisely and in context, especially if they have far-reaching implications. The story of Columbia is a cautionary tale, and it shows that it's high time we rethink how we evaluate success.
