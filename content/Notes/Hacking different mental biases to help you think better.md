### Key Idea

Follow the ten minute rule. 

Fight procrastination by talking yourself into getting started with the ten minute rule. 

There’s a good chance that once you get started, you’ll keep going for longer than ten minutes. 

And even if you don’t, the combined power of the Zeigarnik effect and the Ovsiankina effect will make it more likely you will finish the task later.

So you can combine these things so that you can keep working on it later
