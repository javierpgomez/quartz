### The 2 Maxims of Coaching

This week, I want to share an insight I got from BJ Fogg. He's the author of the book [Tiny Habits](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/6dNloYRsd/c?w=8KjGGDKYiEp43iOxFJ46_u1CSvF5wGdDk7Fnzy2ecHY.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aW55aGFiaXRzLmNvbS9ib29rLyIsInIiOiI5MjlmNjc1Ny1kMjYxLTQ4ODktMDVkOC1kYmEyM2QyYzg1NzQiLCJtIjoibHAifQ) and has done a lot of thinking over the years about behavior, habits, and making changes to ourselves.

[In this podcast episode](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/6dNloYRsd/c?w=DE9MtWXYJ8-lv2Z2xYtA1CRXxXrPllkzApFW-BKQ2PQ.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9iYXJyeW9yZWlsbHkuY29tL2V4cGxvcmUvcG9kY2FzdC9iZWhhdmlvci1kZXNpZ24tdGlueS1oYWJpdHMtYmotZm9nZy8iLCJyIjoiOTI5ZjY3NTctZDI2MS00ODg5LTA1ZDgtZGJhMjNkMmM4NTc0IiwibSI6ImxwIn0), he mentions his 2 maxims of coaching. They are

1.  Help people do what they already want to do
2.  Help people feel successful along the way

### You can also apply this to coaching yourself

1. Help yourself do what you want to do

No one wants to be unhealthy.

No one wants to be unhappy and feel lazy.

We all want to be better in some way.

The desire is already in place. 

We know what we want- we just don't know how to do it

A coach's work is to give suggestions, run some experiments with you and help you learn from those tests. That way we can figure out what works and doesn't work.

If you're applying this to yourself, you can also try different things that will help you take steps towards your goal.

2. Help yourself feel successful along the way

Some of our goals are ambitious.

Running marathons.

Losing 20 pounds.

We won't get there in a few weeks (or months).

But we need small wins in order to stay motivated.

Otherwise you just lose interest and move on.

A coach's work is letting you feel like you're succeeding at every step of the way- not just at the very end.

If you're applying this to yourself, how can you make it feel like you're getting wins a little bit at a time?
