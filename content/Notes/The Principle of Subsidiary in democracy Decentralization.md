### Key Idea

There are too many decisions to make. You need more people making independent decisions, and those people need to be closer to the action to make these decisions.

This principle of subsidiarity keeps the high-level strategy and direction at the top, but most decisions are made at the bottom by the people. It’s as if the leadership designed the mechanism, the substrate, and everybody else filled in the specifics.

1-way following (vs befriending), like neurons * Very short messages, like action potentials * Text-first network = ideas-first network * Owns the attention of decision-makers

I see it with my articles or on Twitter. I improve much faster by publishing something that is 90% there than by waiting to get it to 99% accuracy. Going from 90% to 99% is extremely expensive, whereas going out with 90% guarantees that a reader will correct you if you’re wrong.
