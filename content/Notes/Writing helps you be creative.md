If you want to find your unique voice as a writer, or mover. Talk about it and write about it.

**5. Writing is a connector.** Sharing your work multiplies the power of writing. By “working with the garage door open,” as Robin Sloan [said](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)—you create a feedback loop allowing you to improve your thought processes, learn something new, discover a different way to tackle a problem, or even make friends with like-minded people. Don’t wait until you have a perfect draft of an article. Share to learn, not to shine.
