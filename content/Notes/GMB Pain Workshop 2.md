# GMB Pain Workshop 2

## Quick fire questions I have

1. What are the clues
(as a coach)
that the type of pain a person is going through
is the long term type?

-- I would think to listen
-- and pay attention to the language that's being used.

2. There's a type of client that just wants the pain to go away
Just tell me what to do
Would it work in this case
What strategies would you employ in this case?

3. What is the value of getting a diagnosis then?
Or is it just language
It increases fear and anxiety
How would you suggest relating to a diagnosis?

4. Say a client gets something from a chiro
"You have a neck issue and a lower back issue"
"Got my neck adjusted"

5. Education is helpful
Stories

6. Movement exploration
This is always helpful
Doing something kind of movement is helpful.

To be aware of the sensations in the body

7. Case Studies
Someone has a diagnosis and they feel like it's imperfect.
"It will never be 100% right again"
(It will come back more easily)

Language will help?
- stories and analogies.


## What did I find interesting from the reading?

I found interesting that it takes on a story structure
I like the idea of becoming an active agent in writing the story

## Pain is real

Pain is real
Don't tell people that it's just in their head
(That's really bad pain education)

## Education plays a big role

The biosociopsychological approach
It's all interconnected
- Don't try to separate the three things
Education has physiological changes

Placebo and nocebo effect
- placebo actually make changes
- It's trying to make something work

Nocebo
- The things you say can have negative effects.

## Trust and the therapeutic alliance

Spend more time with people. Create a relationship with them

Key Term: [[Notes/Therapeutic Alliance (concept)]]
- Your client trusts you.

Be useful and be truthful

## A simple definition of good and bad movement

Good movement
- things you can adapt to, and improve

Bad movement
- things you are simply not prepared for.

Think of it more in terms of **capacity** and **requirements**

## How pain works

JARLO is talking now about pain buckets
- there are three
- but it's percentages

Central Sensitization is one of the buckets

FLOSSing? Testings? Nerve mobility?
There are terms I don't know

Central Sensitization is related to what Dr. Melissa Farmer said in the Better Movement Podcast

Somatosensory Homunculus
Somatosensory cortex

Smudging or blurry
- because of all the things that are taking place
- (so body awareness can help I see that)

Two point discrimination
- people with pain can't do this very well
- Because the brain smudges the region

The movement pallette 
(That's a really nice time)
Like the menu of options available to you.
By becoming flexible enough
The idea of having more options is great

So it sounds like it's retraining the brain in some way.

stories,
maps
use it or lose it
healthy 
krisp 
focus

## Investigating Pain (Interviewing people)

Jarlo had some questions when he was investigating pain

Asking about patterns is helpful

If there's something that works subjectively then don't ditch it

Talk more about what we can do to help improve to move better
You will be able to walk better; twist more

Go ahead and lead into explaining yourself
and how you can help them specifically

Let's just move and let me know how you feel
No weights feel safer

Good language
- we can try and figure it out together
