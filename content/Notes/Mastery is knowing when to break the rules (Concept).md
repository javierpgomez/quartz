# Mastery is knowing when to break the rules (Concept)

## Analogy

An athlete who is unorthodox

## The Core idea here
There are rules
There have to be rules
But true experts know when to break the rules

Meaning you know the rules,
But you know the spirit of the rules too.

And it's not something that you can articulate
It's "in your body"

[[Notes/Connaturality (idea)]]

## Maybe there are rules of fitness
And maybe we can figure out when to break them


## Links to the mystics

What interests me about the mystics is that they love traditions and structure. But they also know exactly when to do the opposite.

MÃ­stics know exactly when to break the rules
Even though they love the rules
Spirit not letter
