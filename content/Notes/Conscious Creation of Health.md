# Idea Name

### Context / Source
- Riffing of Cole's ideas


### Key Idea
- If you know the elements, then you can build it consciously, instead of stumbling upon good practices
- Four elements
	- Enjoyment
	- Social
	- Heart rate?
	- Novelty?

When people practice any fad diet. Like keto, or IF.
- These diets work. 
- But they're stumbling on the principles of good health

You just end up succeeding unconsciously. But you're not really able to build good health.

You get stuck on certain rules of eating. And that may work for you now. But you won't be able to recreate that success again later on
