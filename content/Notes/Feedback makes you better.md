# Get feedback often

## Example
Designers make a quick example
Then they get feedback

## Idea

But not just from a coach.
From your own body and mind

Watch videos of good movements

Watch your movements

## Non verbal feedback

! Don't use words. Just watch.

Pay attention to a part

This is kinda amorphous right now
