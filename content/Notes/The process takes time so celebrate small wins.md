### Key Idea

Start doing daily assessments. You document how you're feeling, what you're accomplishing, and what challenges you're facing.

And you start to see a pattern: the days you feel the best are the days you celebrate your small wins. You take time to point out what's going right, instead of dwelling on what's going wrong.

Slowly but surely, you're feeling better and better. And you're reminded that even on the toughest days, there's always something to be grateful for.
