# My writing (250-300 words)

There's a whole generation of people that are going to feel behind because of the pandemic. 

As a business person, an entrepreuner, a mover, a health nut. I can't help but feel like I've fallen behind. As a millenial, I feel like I'm always playing catch up. Everyone looks so much further ahead on their journey. Everyone looks like they've got it all together. I'm the only one trying to figure it out

But that's not true, I'm not the only one

The Catchup Generation is not actually behind, they just feel that way

I would like to back this up with some statistics. About how we're not actually behind. I think the nice idea is that you are exactly where you need to be now. Catching up is a comparisson thing. You feel behind because you're comparing yourself.

What if you are exactly where you need to be now?
What if you accept where you are- and figure out what your one next step is
