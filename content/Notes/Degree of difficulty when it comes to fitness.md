# Degree of difficulty when it comes to fitness

When it comes to anything, we prefer (or it's easier) to be told what to do. These are rules. And there's nothing wrong with these rules. 

## Starting with rules

In fact, when you're starting out, this is the benefit of having a coach.
A coach is someone who can tell you what to do.
And that will help you get started.
Without feeling so overwhelemed

Then you can just focus on doing what you need to do

## Graduating to skills

As you get better though, you'll find yourself in the place where you might become dependent on your coach.
You might feel like you don't know what step to do unless you have your coach giving you exact step by step instructions.

That's the next barrier to leap over

A good coach and a good teacher, will slowly plan to help you transition into a place where you need to rely less on the rules and more on your skills.

You get to learn how to apply intuition.
You get to learn how to trust your instincts.

In a sense you start becoming your own coach.
(And can still benefit from the valuable insight of a coach too)

## It becomes a conversation

A way I like to look at it, is that you develop the ability to converse
The coach is talking and calling all the shots at first.
But later on, as you get better
You can actually dialogue with your coach.

And that's when things really start to get magical.

## Imposter Syndrome

You may have to deal with some imposter syndrome at this point.
You might feel like you're not really getting anywhere
Or you might feel like you don't have to expertise to do the things
Or to teach the things you need to teach.

That's okay.
Trust your own experience. Let that dictate the flow of your teaching

## Teach it to learn it

One good way to transition from rules to skills is to start teaching other people.
By teaching something, you're forced to really clarify it for yourself in order to help other people.

And by teaching, you develop that mindset in yourself that helps you move out of rules and into skills.

Teaching and coaching has really helped me a lot.
Because it keeps me accountable to other people.
I want to help them

But I also realize how much I don't know.
And I'm constantly failing 
Experimenting
and then learning from my failures.
Trying to find different ways that work for me.

## True mastery

Once you move from rules
to skills
then you start to develop true mastery.
You learn when to break the rules and when to follow them.
You learn when to improvise and be creative.
