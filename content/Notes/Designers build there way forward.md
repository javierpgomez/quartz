# Designers build there way forward

## Analogy

Video games
Get good by trying
Failing fast
and trying again super fast
Celeste
quick respawn

## Concept

If I want to see how something will work.
It's easier to try and experiment
and then learn 
and iterate

Exercise and experiment
Build learn then understand 

Create a system
Where you can fail fast 
and learn fast
