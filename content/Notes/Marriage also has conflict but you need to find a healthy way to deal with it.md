### Key Idea

Marriage and conflict is normal
The question is how to deal with conflict effectively
And that's where rituals can control energy

And it's useful in marraige because there will be energy

And they maintained a higher level of overall satisfaction in their marriage. These couples still had conflict! Which is as it should be. We need conflict to get better, to defend ourselves. But we need healthy conflict, and that requires ritualsâ€“like this little hack.
