# My writing (250-300 words)

In these studies, they saw that rodents ran faster the closer they got to the reward. You can see this in marathon runners, where when the finish line is in sight, they have an extra burst of energy.

I know what this feels like too, when I was an athlete, when I was so close to the goal, I was so motivated to get to it. Partly because of the excitement of the goal, and partly just to get it over with. Haha

Motivation can intensify when your goal is closer

But how can this apply to lifelong health? A long and distant goal?
