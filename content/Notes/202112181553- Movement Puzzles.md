# My writing (250-300 words)

One of the problems I have with exercises and movement is that they're so rote

It feels like I'm just going through the motions. I feel like a robot. It's not really fun, inspiring, expressive or creative. I want to express myself when I move- and have fun in the process also

That's why I thought it might be interesting to design movement puzzles

For example: Can I get up off the ground without using my hands?

It's providing artificial constraints that ask me to think differently about the way I move. And maybe to not rely on my usual or standard solutions for movement
