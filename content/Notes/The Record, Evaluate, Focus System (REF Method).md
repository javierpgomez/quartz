# The Record, Evaluate, Focus System (REF Method) 

## Key Idea
### RECORD
- Capture;
- Gather Data

### EVALUATE
- What do I see?
- 

### FOCUS
- (There's limited resources here)
- So pick one!
- This is in terms of attention (Where will you pay attention too?)
- Knowing what you know- how will you attend to it?
