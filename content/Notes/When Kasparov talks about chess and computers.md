# Chess and computer

When Kasparov talks about chess and computers
He's faced them way before we really have.

When we talk about how scary computers are.
He felt that fear back in the 80s
So he has some idea of what we may be going through now.

For me,
Use smart computing
combined with human knowledge

interpret data well
and make smart choices for myself
