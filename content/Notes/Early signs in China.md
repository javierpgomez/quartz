### Key Ideas

2017, Liu Yazhou, a general in the People’s Liberation Army and a son-in-law of a former president, wrote to Xi recommending that China reverse its policy in Xinjiang and cease rounding up members of the Uyghur minority. He was warned not to speak ill of Xi’s policies. Xi’s refusal to accept such counsel removes an important method of self-correction.

That's interesting because that was the last time I was in China, and I didn't know back then how bad things were going to get. It seems to be part of this idea that 2016 to 2020 is when things started to really go crazy. Leading up to covid

That reminds me of the [[Notes/On the Lab Leak Theory]]
It's similar because China is a crazy place, and it's so opaque, I don't really know what's going on
It's different because of course it's a whole different thing. Though it's also about authoritarianism
It's important because I like to try to understand China.
