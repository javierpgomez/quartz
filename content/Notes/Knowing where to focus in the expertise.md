### Key Idea

How do you know where to focus? 

The answer is a deep fluency in the problem. 

You need to embed yourself in the problem and the details.

You need to try things, reflect, and learn. 

Sooner or later, you start to understand the hidden asymmetry.

It's something that comes with time and experience and there's no shortcut to it honestly
