# My writing (250-300 words)

When I look at all the different approaches to health, I notice you can divide them into 2 different categories: Health From and Health for

Health From is when people aim to be healthy because they're afraid

They're afraid of getting sick
They're afraid of looking unattractive
They're afraid of death
They're afraid of being weak

And that's fine, but it's completely different from Health For

What is 'Health For'?

It's when you choose to be healthy not because you're trying to avoid something. But because there's something you want to do or experience

I want to be healthy so that I can play with my kids
I want to be healthy so that I can hike and travel
I want to be healthy so that I can enjoy my old age

Are you in a health from? or in a health for? state of mind
