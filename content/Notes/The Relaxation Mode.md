### Key Idea


That's interesting because it is counterintuitive that being in a relaxed mode will lead to better (and amazing performances)

That reminds me of the false idea of [[No pain no gain]],
It's similar because both are about achieving results and top performance
It's different because one is clearly more sustainable than the other
It's important because we think things should come from a place of struggle, but in reality they should be coming from a place of ease
