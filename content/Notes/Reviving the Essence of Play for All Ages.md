In the modern world, the concept of play has been restricted to children, often framed as a phase of life that ends once adult responsibilities kick in. This truncated perspective overlooks the profound psychological and physiological benefits of play that extend throughout one's lifetime. 

Play is not a childish endeavor but an essential facet of human nature that nurtures creativity, problem-solving abilities, and emotional resilience.

The societal drift towards productivity and "useful" activities has not only stripped children of unstructured playtime but also deprived adults of the joy and stress-relief that come from playful activities. This can contribute to rising rates of mental health issues across all age groups.

We should be asking ourselves why we took play away from children and made it about productivity, rather than extending the liberty to play to all age groups. It's time to redefine play as a lifelong necessity, not just a childhood luxury. 

Instead of seeing play as something we grow out of, let's consider it something we grow intoâ€”continuously, at every stage of our lives.
