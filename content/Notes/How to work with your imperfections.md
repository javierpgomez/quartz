# My writing (250-300 words)

The problem is not becoming perfect

It's all about learning to work with your imperfections. Because if you can accept that you're not perfect, then you'll be in a good position to keep on going.

If you think you need to be perfect, then you're going to stop right away

Like this writing process. I'm trying to get it right the first time. Ends up being terrible.

Just flow and let it be shit- then you'll improve and learn
