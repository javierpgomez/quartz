### Key Ideas

The "got-done list" is a productivity technique that complements traditional "to-do lists" by providing a way for individuals to keep track of their accomplishments. The idea is that by keeping a running log of things that have been completed, individuals can gain a sense of progress and motivation to continue working towards their goals. The got-done list can be used by anyone, but it is particularly useful for clients who have found that digital tools alone do not effectively help them stay on top of their tasks. The technique is simple to implement, and it can be used to record accomplishments of any size, whether they be big or small. By keeping a got-done list alongside a to-do list, individuals can gain a more holistic view of their productivity and progress.
