# My writing (250-300 words)

The one reason you should stop exercising and start moving

--

Technology doesn't save time, it actually saves movement

People think of technology as gadgets and devices that make life more convenient. It lets us talk to each other over long distances. It lets us order food and let it come right to our door. It builds cars and engines that let us travel around. But we think convenient means more productive. But convenient can also mean move less.

Katy Bowman a movement researcher reframes technology as less movement- not more convenience.

Technology is anything that outsources movement you used to do.

Making clothes used to be incredible manual labor and physical work. But now, there are machines can do that also. Look at every machine in your life- and see how it's outsourcing movement in some way. The telelphone is outsourcing the walk to the neighbors. The car outsources the walk.

Technology isn't bad, but we have to understand the tradeoffs we're making.

--

We love technology. It changes everything.

But don't let yourself be automatically dragged into it. Train yourself to see the world and the movement you're letting go of when you choose to adopt technology. Understand what you're sacrificing.

Be aware and in control of your technology-movement trade-off.
