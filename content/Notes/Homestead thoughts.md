# Homestead thoughts

Workout space
- This isn't really essential.
- Just a place to hang some rings
- Do some calisthenics
- But I think it should be video worthy somehow also 
- In case I need to shoot some footage

Cellar
- This is the best place to store stuff
- cool and dry
- Maybe a freezer we can plug in?

Catio
- Pippin will stay here permanently na
- Into his old age
- When we leave for Makati to spend time with the montis, we won't bring him out of here anymore.
- We can also split it too
- Think of cat human areas as venn diagrams
- He should be able to roam freely within cat areas (not rely on doors)
- Cat doors

Outside cleaning area
- For boots, trash bins
- anything we want to clean outside

Living Space
- Hangers for clothes
	- clean, outside drying, inside drying
- Kitchen space to cool
- Bedrooms are more of guest rooms, because we will permanently sleep in the RV
- A shower / Bath

Homestead features
- Rain collection
- Solar? Wind?

A coop
- For chickens
- Free range? Semi Free

Space for parking an RV
- A space to plug it in
- So that we can park, plug and sleep in the RV

RV
- Like a portable bedroom
- Well Insulated and comfortable to sleep in
- Is there an air conditioning unit?
- How would that even work haha.
- I'd like it to be low key kasi and not attract too much attention
- Plus water tanks somehow too

Garden
- Raised bed type


Workshop size
- Like a garage size
- right now I'm thinking it's like 6m x 6m
- Table Saw, mitre saw, jig saw
- Planner, router table?

Insulation
