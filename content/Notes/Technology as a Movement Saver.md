### Technology does not save time, it saves movement

This week, I watched [this lecture from Katie Bowman.](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/f3NnT9Q0k/c?w=WwuITNMO1uDFM_HtIrjBh6WKeTpQpgQQ-5kqgE0Xdbk.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9ZdGIzaDV2aEZYNCIsInIiOiI5MjlmNjc1Ny1kMjYxLTQ4ODktMDVkOC1kYmEyM2QyYzg1NzQiLCJtIjoibHAifQ)

Her goal is to help us think differently about movement. She may have done that for me.

A few minutes into the lecture, she said "Most conveniences do not save time; they save movement." [(You can skip to that part here)](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/f3NnT9Q0k/c?w=KJ4fmCO7p9wqKM_F09J1d2QATiHGvEECXGeMbC5KgYM.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9ZdGIzaDV2aEZYND90PTQzMyIsInIiOiJmMDI4MWZmNy1lMjZlLTRhMzEtMzM1ZS0wZmEwMWI5MWRkNjkiLCJtIjoibHAifQ)

I can't get this idea out of my head. It feels like I've known this, but I haven't been able to express it this way. I've always thought of modern technology as something that makes my life easier. For the first time, I'm realizing that making my life easier == moving much less.

This may grow into a real shift in world view for me.

I can't stop seeing it everywhere:

-   Delivery apps bring the food to us (no more hunting)
-   Social media lets us meet online (less parties and dinner, no standing, no dancing)
-   Even a chair outsources movement (back can rest, legs can hang)

I'm now trying to find areas where technology takes away from movement- and I want to see if I can get it back.

### I would like to train myself to see the tech-movement exchange in my life

I don't need to take back all my movement.

(Sometimes technology helps-- I really am grateful I don't have to hunt for my food)

But there are many other areas where you can recover some movement:

-   Ditch the back rest, or the chair altogether - use a stool, sit on the floor

-   No delivery - Walk to lunch, meet up with someone who lives nearby

-   Shop at physical stores, use a basket- not a cart

### Learn to view tech and movement as interchangable

Then you can make the choice when to give and take. With practice you can actively shape the amount of movement you get during your day- without having to add any exercise in
