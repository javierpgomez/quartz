# My writing (250-300 words)

But what does it mean to be in relationship with God?

Someone you talk to on the phone? Someone you speak to every day? I don't know. I wish I knew. It feels like being able to cultivate an active presence (what does that even mean?) To have a sense that the person is there. That I exist with God in mind. That I think about what God would do.

That I live in awareness of his being

I've always had a weird time with the relationship thing with God.

Like- I'm not really a chatty person anyway. So with my own friends- I'm not always really reaching out- talking and connecting. But I do consider these deep relationships where we're always in touch and thinking of each other. We live in awareness that the person is there.

That's what relationship feels like I think
