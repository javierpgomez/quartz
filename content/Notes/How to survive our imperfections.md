The goal of the healthy life is not about being perfect

Aiming to be perfect is an impossible goal and you will never reach it. Forver trying to optimize and find the best or most perfect solution. But the truth is that you will despair. You will just go around in cirlces

The idea is not to be perfect, but to find a way to survive our imperfections

Because we will always be imperfect, there will always be something wrong

And that's okay. I'm not alright, you're not alright, but that's alright. There's nothing wrong with not being alright (all the time). What you're looking for is a system that allows you to live with your imperfections

Now what does that system look like?
