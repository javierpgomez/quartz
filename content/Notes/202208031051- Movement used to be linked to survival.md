# My writing (250-300 words)


When it comes to survival, movement used to be everything. 

If we wanted to eat, we needed to grow our own food or hunt down an animal. If we wanted to survive an attack, we needed to be able to run away quickly. And if we wanted to reproduce, we needed to get out there and meet people.

Nowadays, thanks to technology, we don't need to worry about any of that. We can get our food from the grocery store, we can stay safe from predators with the help of security systems, and we can meet potential partners online. In other words, technology has saved us a whole lot of movement.

And that's not necessarily a good thing. For one thing, it means we're not getting the movement we used to.
