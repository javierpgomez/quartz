People who emerge from tragedy functioning at a higher level than before exhibit a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth.

That reminds me of [[Notes/Antifragility]], and how it's okay to experience stress, trials, and even trauma. Because we are antifragile, which means we are able to recover and grow quickly.

With help and a proper professional. You can find a way to grow.
