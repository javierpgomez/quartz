# Opportunities for immersion

That's the best way to learn.
Because it's contextual.
Generating this is a way to accelarate learning

## creating a context

So I was like living in China
Going to a pole vault camp

But how to create those kinds of opportunities

How can you create a learning context.

Some place where you can learn in a more immersed and focused way
To recreate a bit of that experience.

Where there are real stakes?
And it doesn't really feel articificial.

Like language learning?
Or physical fitness.

Making it practical somehow?
