[[Notes/Hormesis]] exhibits a paradoxical phenomenon known as a biphasic dose response, whereby low doses produce beneficial effects but high doses produces harmful effects. In other words, the dose makes the poison.

It's not that stress is bad per se
It's the dosage of stress that's actually bad for you
So the goal is to have the right dosage

That's interesting because we tend to think of stress as a bad thing all the time, but that's not true

That reminds me of weightlifting, and how it's a game of stress management [[Deal with stress and manage weight]], also just [[Notes/Keep in mind the biological definition of stress]]
It's similar because we understand that sweet spot idea when it comes to exercise, but not so much when it comes to work.
It's different because we tend to accept our physical limits more than our emotional limitations.
It's important because our mental health is just as important as our physical health.
