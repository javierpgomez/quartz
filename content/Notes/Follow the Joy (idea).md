# Follow the Joy (idea)

## Idea

This is about doing what makes you happy
(This isn't a great articulation because it's cliche)

It's about seeing what excites you.
When you try something out and it hooks you, why don't you see what you gets you going

## Application to fitness

Do the workouts that make you happy

## What if there's nothing

That's how I feel right now.
There's no joy.
Nothing makes me feel happy.
I don't really want to do anything.
What makes me happy in working out

Going on a walk.
I don't want to be strong
I just want to be outside and move a little bit

I think I'm depressed

## Act yourself into a new way of being

If you choose to run around
and be a bit more active,
then maybe the mind will follow

it's like how in sobriety
you show up
and then you become a sober person

**I think being back in this house is really not good for me.
Going out and being in the beach was way better

## Walk yourself and run yourself

I'm looking forward to moving
So that I can go out and run and walk and move again

I feel that I'm anxious about the delta strain
It's that same cycle of uncertainty
It could be anywhere kind of feeling that going on in me.
