# The Cultural Cold War

## Source:
- I read this in some LRB article

## Key idea:
- How the CIA pushed certain types of culture and art
- In order to control what the world was like
	- it's a control of culture
- I think now of how Modi is trying to take over Bollywood
- Or how China probably has a lot to say about how movies and cultural things are made
