When you're brainstorming, it's better to bring EVERY idea to the table, including the craziest and wildest ideas.

Surprisingly, even with a little modification, those outrageous ideas may later become the most plausible solutions.

But to do this, you have to silence your inner judge, or inner critic. There's an instinct that rushes to feel like "This is a bad idea." 

Throw all ideas into the ring, regardless of how far-fetched they might be. 

This is sometimes referred to as non-judgmental, non-rational divergent thinking.

This reminds me of another idea: [Try Googling the Opposite](Notes/Try%20Googling%20the%20Opposite.md)

It's a very conscious way to combat your biases and think in ways that you normally would not.
