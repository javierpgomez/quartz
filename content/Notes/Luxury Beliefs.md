## Key Ideas:
- (Okay I get that New York Post is NYPost)
- But the idea of how beliefs apply to some but not to all
	- No universal truths
	- "Rules for thee, not for me"
- Kind of a derivation of relativism

## Highlights
- Another luxury belief is that religion is irrational or harmful. Members of the upper class are most likely to be atheists or non-religious. But they have the resources and access to thrive without the unifying social edifice of religion.
- Then there’s the luxury belief that individual decisions don’t matter much compared to random social forces, including luck. 
	- The key message is that the outcomes of your life are beyond your control. This idea works to the benefit of the upper class and harms ordinary people.
