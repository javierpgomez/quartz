# Barrels vs ammunition

### Context / Source

### Key Idea
- You can only do how many barrels you have
- So it doesn't matter how much ammunition you have. You're limited by the number of barrels your gun has.

- So it applies to brain capacity I think.
- After a while, you just don't have the capacity to do anything anymore
