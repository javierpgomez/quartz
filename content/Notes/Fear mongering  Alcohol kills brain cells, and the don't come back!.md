# Fear mongering: Alcohol kills brain cells, and the don't come back!

That's not true!
They come back.
You can talk about neuroplasticity
or adaptibility 

So these kinds of things are not really true 

## The Truth

The truth is that you're always learning
You're always growing
and you're always changing

It relates to fixed mindset and growth mindset to me
