Shin-Gi-Tai translates as “mind, technique, and body.”

The framework can also be applied to building habits. 

The framework can be mapped to the Fogg Behavior Model, which is expressed as a short formula: Behavior = Motivation (Mind), Ability (Technique), and Prompt (Body)

If you don't act with mindfulness it's not going to be any good
