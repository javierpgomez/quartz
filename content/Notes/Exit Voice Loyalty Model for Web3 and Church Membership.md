# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

Albert O. Hirschman’s “Exit-Voice-Loyalty” model

users can voice concerns to try to change their situation; exit to new platforms; or wait, out of loyalty, for the situation to resolve.

Do you create a schism
or do you try to reform the current one?

Schism is easier than reform
But it's worth doing too
