# Strategy and Tactics in Chess

In chess, there are usually two kinds of players.
People who are good at tactics
They see sequences that can give them an advantage
Flashy
Tricky
Clever

Strategy is the general plan
They like positional chess.
You won't see big flashy moves.
But they grind out the win.
