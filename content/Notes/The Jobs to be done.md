# The Jobs to be done

What is the job that I'm doing
That someone would find worthwhile

Right now, it feels like I'm relieving the pressure of having to do all the research yourself.

So in a world, where there's so much information.
It's hard to know what it reliable and what it useful.

In this case, I show that I provide a certain kind of mindset and information.

So that when they work with me,
they know exactly what kind of resources they're getting.
And how it can help them and benefit them specifically

This is what I'm doing here.
