# The problem

The tricky thing is that for so many people, fitness is a black box. They don't understand how it work. They're left with so many questions and they're always left wondering if they're doing the right thing.

Do you find that you always wonder:
- What should I do next?
- Am I doing the right thing?
- Is there something that I'm over looking.

In order to counter this, try to take a principles approach to your fitness.
