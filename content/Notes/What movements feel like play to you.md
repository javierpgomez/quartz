Everyone wants to know "What exercise should I do?"

But that question is so broad and hard to answer. There are so many factors involved? What's your age? Where do you live? What is your experience with exercise?

The most important thing for me is what I call the "fun factor"

Everyone wants to know what's optimal, but we all overlook what's ACTUALLY fun. But your chances of sticking to your program go way up if you do something that you find fun.

So try asking "What feels like play to me?"

Do you like hiking? You should hike more. Do you rolling around or monkeying around in the playground? Is there a way to build that into your routine. Stop treating exercise like work.

Enjoy yourself, have fun, and your health will come
