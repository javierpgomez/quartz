# Evergreen Notes

Evergreen notes is this idea that your notes just grow over time. 

They're linked to principles and ideas. And as you learn more about them you can let them grow.

I really like the idea that as you learn more, you just add and your understanding of things grows and grows

There's analogies here to growing plants.
[[sowing seeds]]
[[begin patient in gardening]]
[[making mistakes]]
and 
[[letting things die]]
