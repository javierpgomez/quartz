“Maintenance has to be valued outside of austerity, and right now it’s unclear if our current economic system is capable of that.”

Note: I think being able to fix things is a spiritual skill. Because it asks you to do hard work and restore the value in something that seems left for dead.

Nick Offerman has this quote "Things break, and those that fix things are better members of society"

There is tension in the question of whether to build objects more intensively, so that they last longer, or to recognize that some things cannot endure and thus should be designed that way.

**Note:** I think I fall into the latter camp here. You cannot future proof everything

I used to purchase the best and latest. Let it last 3-5 years, then scrap and upgrade

But I think I'm more in the maintain now. I want to buy things that will last my whole life as much as possible
