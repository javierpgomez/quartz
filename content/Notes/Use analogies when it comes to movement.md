# Use analogies when it comes to movement

Fitness analogies do a really good job!
For movements.
So for example when you swing a golf swing
Think about chopping wood or something

That's crazy!

So like badminton strikes.
or whatever

[[Notes/When coaching, use less words]]

This one has to do more with physical skills
and not so much with mindset
