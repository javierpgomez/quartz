# My writing (250-300 words)

Turns out that Math, Mysticism and Health point to my north star

There’s a thread that ties them all together- a love for knowledge and a desire for happiness. My Math journey was a desire for truth, and beauty. I was pushed into for practical (financial) reasons. But I grew to love the harmony of numbers and the patterns that transcend cultures
 

Mysticism was the next step- different people’s attempts to make sense of the world. And how they managed to express something universal at a particular point in time, in a particular culture, and in a particular way.

  
Health is my popular expression of mysticism- a desire to live healthy happy and whole lives while connected to not just your body, but your mind, your community, and even a deeper sense of purpose
