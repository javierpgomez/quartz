For Jeanne:
- Adding something to the offer

For me:
- Scripts - ? for sales? what's this one about

**- Has a 4 thread target**
- Customer avatar
- Dailing down into who you're targetting
	- It's gotta be a runner
	- Runner, parent, busy, no time, too late for me,
	- Stuck, busy, professional parent
- Challenging perspective for those people
- 

Great question she asked me
- What would it take to make that happen

- worksheets in your 12 week challenge
- How was this week, what did you learn?
- Process goals
	- Questions to help them get there
- It needs to be more async-
- The niche was specific because they had no time
- Simple is better in this case

- I have to get it running right away
- Deliver your own thing
- And you; upsell
- I can't control

- You'll get your transformed mindset
- Then program is for you- if you're not willing to do the work
- The program is not for you
- This is what coaching is
- That's

**What to expect - Coaching**
- Very useful for me to see what it looks like for your business
- I currently do not do this (so I find it valuable to see)
- As a coach, if this were a template (I could see your version- and then customize it for my business), then it would be so much more valuable! (would pay more)
- Selling point is:
	- See how I prepare my clients before we even meet
	- Edit it to fit your coaching business and style

**Health and Wellness Assessment**
- Personally, I already have an onboarding form similar to this
	- unlike the 'What to expect - coaching'
- So the value for me is seeing how you do it, and then deciding if I would make changes to my current one
- Similar to What to expect - Coaching, if this were editable, I would find it more valuable


**The Vision Statement Package**
- This was my favorite and the most valuable
- I already have a worksheet where I do this with clients.
- But I don't have a script written down
- So seeing your talking points + template was very valuable to me!
- Something I would adapt for my own practice (and it's great that they're Word files- I can edit them!)
- This is is more premium to me as a coach (I would pay more for this)


**Client Vision Statement**
- I already had a worksheet for this
- But haven't updated it in a while
- As a coach, I would cross reference with my current form
- Borrow ideas and statements that I like
- Incorporate it and adapt it for my workflow

**Vision Statement Session Talking Points**
- Love scirpts and templates
- Reading Deploy empathy
- Also has a ton of scripts
- if there a live audio sample
- Of something you did
- Super valuable

**Vision Statement Template**
- Also a great script
- Something I can follow
- Context on how to use this
- And who it works well for
