### Interview with Rosy

Q:
What are you doing now?

It's because I'm targeting more specifically people who are stuck in injury and want to build mental fitness to trust their body again

What was your situation?

If you remember, where did you go? Who did you see and talk to?

After the physical therapy process, how was it then? What was your next step?

Did you feel confident? What changed about your movement or the way you felt about your body?

### The story

**2014 - back problem for a long time**
- my back hurt
- Visited the doctor
	- not so extreme
	- would go away in a few days
	- Used things like backjoy / pillows

**2018 - Uniqlo**
- more healthier
- good workout routine / bodyweight
- more stressed at work
- One day more painful
	- probably something wrong with a movement
- Saw a doctor
	- same diagnosis
	- Stress related

**2019 Jan**
- After Panama
	- Scary incident 
	- Really painful - report due for work at the time
	- Rushed to the ER
		- Had a MRI
		- Slight slipped disk
		- Altered the way you view things
	- More on the fence about always worried

**There was 3 months of rehab after the ER experience**
- The Physical Therapist felt that you were okay na
- Live your life, don't just rely on going to rehab
- Wasn't really the best mentally- 
- She would rather do the fun part of getting stronger
- I'm stuck in rehab feeling (wanted to get on with stuff)

**Today:**
Still happens now, especially when you're on your period
- Pandemic made it better
- A lot of rest time
- Slept better
- Less Stressed from work

**Better now.** 
- When there's a period
- There's better time management
- Paying attention to the back pain

**Trigger points are driving:**
- stay at home- 1 week
- my body hurts from driving

**What do you do when you have the back pain now?**
- I had a system before
- Stretches and exercises
- Hot compress & comfort
- Stretching does help
- Currently- 2x online crossfit coaching
	- Knowing that your back is fragile

**More likely to take a class now**
- for that assurance that someone is taking 

**Going back to the bodyweight exercises**
- But had to miss a business trip also
- Prior to panama, a lot of resting
- Missing family trips; 

There's like an energy or movement budget

**Do you look for support?**

- Getting physical support with the coach
- It's good to have that mental support also
- It would be good to meet people who have gone through something similar

Still looking at social media, reading posts and stuff.
