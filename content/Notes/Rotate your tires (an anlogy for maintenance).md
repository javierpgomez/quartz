- Even if you take care of your car perfectly. There are always some things that you'll need to do and maintenance
- And if you ignore these things It will set you up for challenges down the line
- So rotate your tires and Change your oil

### There's entropy
- Nothing just works all the time
- And no solution are permanent
- You'll always need to do maintenance

- There is never a one size fits all fix or there's never a permafix
- There will always need to be some maintenance work in time or money or effort

### In response: Set up a system

- Set up a system, So that the maintenance is more manageable
- For example:
	- I have a system to pay my bills
	- And I don't have to always do it manually
	- Or use the mental energy to do it
- If you can accept that it will never go away
- and it's never going to be automatic
- - And it's never going to just work all the time

### Identify Your Tasks
- Identify the tasks
- Set it up
- Create a system
- Automate
- or "sharpen the axe"
