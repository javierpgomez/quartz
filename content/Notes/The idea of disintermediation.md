### Key Idea

What is disintermediation.
It's a business model where if it does its job well, then it makes itself obsolete

So like if you start with an app to find a good massage therapist

But when you find a good one, you'd rather just get their number

So you don't need the app anymore

I think matching apps kind of have this problem

Though I will say that if my goal is to make it so that you don't need a coach anymore.

What does that say about your ongoing relationship with your coach? Am I making myself useless with my business model?
