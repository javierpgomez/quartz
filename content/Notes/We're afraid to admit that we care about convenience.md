### Key Idea

Why doesn’t a rival politician gain power by promising to make convenience great again?  Because “convenience” sounds petty and ignoble.  People love convenience.  They happily sacrifice other values for convenience.  But they don’t want to acknowledge this fact – or affiliate with those who do.

**Note:** Think clothing, food, and everything

No one really likes to admit that they're all about convenience

Like I just put an order for Lazada

And I would go straight to the source. But the world doesn't make it easy to do that. Even if I wanted to I have no idea how to do it
