# Don Quixote is a stubborn person (story)

Is not romantic
The idea that we have to stick to our eccentricities all the way
It's stubborn 

Think Again is a book
Is an anti Don Quixote
Where you ought to be able to change your mind. 
And get in touch with reality again.

There are other ways to look at this
Malcom Gladwell is kind of Quixotian 
Because he just chases crazy ideas forever
