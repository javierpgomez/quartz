We often measure the price of success in terms of financial investment, time, or energy. However, there's a subtler currency at play: the richness of life experiences, relationships, and well-being. When we say 'yes' to a pursuit, we're implicitly saying 'no' to something elseâ€”often things that don't have a price tag but are invaluable nonetheless.

#### Key Questions to Ponder:

- What am I willing to trade off for success? Is it time with family, personal well-being, or perhaps even peace of mind?
- How can I be honest with myself about these trade-offs to avoid the trap of the sunk cost fallacy?
- What does being "rich in other areas" mean to me? How can I incorporate this richness into my definition of success?

This concept is akin to the **economic principle of opportunity cost**, but it extends beyond mere financials. It's about the richness of life that can't be quantified but can certainly be felt. Understanding this can help us approach new ventures with a more holistic sense of what we're willing to "pay."
