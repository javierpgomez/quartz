# My writing (250-300 words)

There was this story about how some titas of manila would just patron priests

and get them to do their own masses for them. And travel with them
But then those priests are already acting outside their jurisdiction.

So they're already acting outside of Rome

And those participating in it are not in communion with the Church.
