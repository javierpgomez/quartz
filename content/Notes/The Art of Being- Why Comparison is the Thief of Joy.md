**The Trap of Comparison**

Paudre Gautuma's words resonate deeply with me. In a world that often feels like a constant competition, it's easy to fall into the trap of comparison. Whether it's in the realm of poetry, health coaching, or any other field, comparing oneself to others can be a creativity killer. It's like a mental treadmill—you're running but going nowhere.

**The Value of Learning**

That's not to say we should exist in a vacuum. Learning from others is crucial. It's how we grow and evolve in our respective fields. But there's a fine line between learning and comparing. The former empowers us; the latter disempowers us. It's the difference between seeing someone's work and thinking, "What can I learn from this?" versus "Why can't I be like this?"

**Late Bloomers and the Illusion of Time**

Feeling like you've come late to something shouldn't diminish your passion or your potential contributions. In fact, sometimes coming in "late" can offer a fresh perspective, unburdened by the jadedness that can come with years in a field. It's never too late to make a meaningful impact.

**Why This Matters to Me**

As someone who's building a coaching practice and striving to be a thought leader, I find this a timely reminder. Comparison can be a significant roadblock, but it's one that can be overcome by focusing on my unique voice and contributions. It's not about being the first or the best; it's about being authentically me.
