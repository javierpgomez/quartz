Experience is often hailed as the ultimate educator—a belief I've held close in my journey. But the wisdom of Soyer and Hogarth in "The Myth of Experience" challenges this notion. It's an eye-opener: not all lessons from experience are beneficial. The rarity of certain events, like earthquakes, means our exposure is limited, and our lessons, potentially flawed.

This brings me to a realization: experience can be a deceptive guide. I've seen it firsthand. We encounter a situation, draw conclusions, and then something unprecedented happens. It's a reminder that what I learn from each experience is filtered through the lens of what I've previously encountered, which might not always be the right angle.

It's crucial to dissect experiences critically, asking myself, "Is this a genuine pattern or a one-off event?" This introspection is vital. It keeps my conclusions in check, preventing the misinterpretation of anomalies as norms.

For me, it's become about seeking the delicate balance—valuing experience while being vigilant of its potential to mislead. I have to be as much a critic as a student of my own experiences, ensuring that the right lessons stick.
