I'm uncomfortable about how AI makes me feel.

My first thought when I was thinking about what AI can do for us, is to realize that it can serve and make my life easier. But when I was listening to the evening rocket- it made me realize that that was a servant-master or a slave-master paradigm. It betrays my own sense of class dominance- and how I come from a master class.

I want to break away from that somehow

Are there different paradigms to think about AI?

Is it possible to think of robots and AI as kin? That sounds crazy, insane and unimaginable right now. But it is where I'd like to go. My goal is to see myself as connected to everything- though as I write- I realize I mean everything natural (in the natural world). 

I want to feel connected to the earth, the crops- but what about devices and gadgets?

//

If they are pure tools, then maybe I'm thinking about things wrong

Maybe I cannot limit my kinship to some things only. I like to imagine my connection to a table- to food- to the worker who made the things that I consume. Wouldn't AI be in the same place also? They make things that I take part in- and I cannot imagine that I'm separate from them.

I need to expand my thinking
