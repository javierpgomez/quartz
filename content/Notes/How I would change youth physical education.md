This is from Peter Attia's Podcast, The Drive, when he talks with Beth Lewis in the "Art of Stability"

I think that Physical Education classes are extremely important, but I would change the way they are taught. I would get rid of all organized sports and just let the kids play.

I believe that kids learn best through trial and error. If they are just given the opportunity to move, they will figure out what works and what doesn't. And they will learn so much more than they ever could from a textbook.

So that's my plan. More play, less lectures. I think it would make a world of difference in the way kids learn about movement and their bodies.

Remember [How Play Trains you up for Adult Skills](Notes/How%20Play%20Trains%20you%20up%20for%20Adult%20Skills.md).
