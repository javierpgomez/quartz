# My writing (250-300 words)
This is like the consolidated ideas.
It should be some that flows out of a natural process too.

Like a have a system for logging.
And then I have a system for reviewing the things that have been logged.
(So like this right now)
My system is taking down notes of my thoughts.
And then randomizing the notes to solidify them and really get them down
And then I synthesize them as blog posts.

So I wonder if logging and getting ideas and understandings about the body is no different than just the [Zettelkasten](Notes/Zettelkasten.md) note taking system that I've honed.

Maybe link this now to design thinking
