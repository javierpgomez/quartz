### Key Ideas

The body is tough and can take a lot of wear and tear, explains Kelly Starrett, a doctor of physical therapy and co-author of the best-selling movement book, Becoming a Supple Leopard. You just have to believe that the body is anti-fragile and not fragile (we can get stronger after injuries)

The resting state of the human body is pain-free. Pain is your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong and needs to be fixed, Starrett says. The sensation can come from an injury or physical impairment (in which case you should talk to your doctor) but it can also result from tissue stiffness, not moving enough, or sitting weirdly.

Starrett made it clear that you shouldn’t be walking around sore every day. Working in an office shouldn’t leave you hurting. And if it does, it’s a sign that you need to address the problem. Locate the problem, figure out what system it’s a part of, and find an exercise that will help.

According to Kelly Starrett, you shouldn't be in pain when you press down on your muscles or stretch them out. 

Additionally, you should be able to breathe comfortably while you're working on something. If you're foam rolling and you're in agony, stop--you're doing something wrong. 

Starrett explains that moving well and without pain isn't a game you can win. There's no point at which you can declare victory and say you're done; that your knee is totally fixed and you'll be able to hop, skip, and jump into your 90s. Modern life is always going to throw you curveballs and you'll need to adapt.

That's interesting because we are getting to a point where people are understanding the importance of always moving.

That reminds me of [[Notes/Antifragility]] and how it applies to the body
It's similar because the body is something that can get stronger over time
It's different because antifragility applies to the mind, but it can also apply to the body
It's important because we need to adapt and not be perfect if we're going to grow
