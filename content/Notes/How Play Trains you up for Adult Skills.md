"When you play, you are developing skills that you can use later in life."

I have always felt that sports is a great learning ground for how to be a good person. But I think it's less about discipline (as important as that is) and it's more about creativity.

At the end of the day, I think it's less about sport and more about play. Play is about improvising, learning how to learn, being able to adapt and improvise.

When you move, exercise, or do anything, you should ask: [What movements feel like play to you](Notes/What%20movements%20feel%20like%20play%20to%20you.md)
