Several studies argue that activities that involve touching nonhuman entities with our bodies – walking barefoot or swimming, for instance – might help us nurture affective and ethical relationships with the nonhuman world.

That's interesting because the idea of ethical relationships with the nonhuman world is a big part of things. Being able to respect the 'life' of everything, is a powerful and creative way of thinking

That reminds me the [The Biophilic Hypothesis](Notes/The%20Biophilic%20Hypothesis.md) and the [The Mycelial person by Tim Ingold](Notes/The%20Mycelial%20person%20by%20Tim%20Ingold.md)

It's similar because being in the world is a big part of it. I definitely feel connected to life, the mountain, the sky. But it's easy to do it with a big thing, something large and transcendent. But with little things it is challenging

It's different because this one is a big more mystical. The biophilic hypothesis feels very scientific. The mycelial person is quite mystical though

It's important because if we are to transform the world, change the systems, imagine new ways of living- then we have to change the way we think too
