# Principal-agent problem

This is the problem where the person who is representing you
does not experience the problem in the same way as you

For example
An insrunace broker
doesn't really lose money
They might lose your business
But they don't really carry the risk

Can I trust my coach. 
Who doesn't directly carry the risk
say the risk of injury
or the risk of health

## Counter Idea
[[Notes/Therapeutic Alliance (concept)]]
where you work together to feel better
