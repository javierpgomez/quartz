by: [[Gabriele Wulf]]

## Key ideas

- Automacity is when performers concentrate on the intended movement effect, their motor system uses a more automatic control mode.
- This is in contrast to focusing internally and using conscious control

- It may be about providing a good context where you can learn things and deep remember them
	- My Mandarin was a survive environment.
	- Can I learn skills in that kind of space?

## Examples / Stories
- I think of my Mandarin speaking
	- I learned it in a context, so there's some second nature to it
