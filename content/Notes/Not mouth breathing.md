# Not mouth breathing

## Context

Until today, I still sleep with my mouth closed
I tape my mouth

Breathing through your nose 
can control how you feel think and behave
How your body reacts

## Why is it important

Breathing and regulating CO2
Has to do with blood CO2 levels
and blood acidity levels
