### [It's not that you're 'unmotivated' you just might be overwhelmed](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/deNrKoOC3/c?w=YYWvvnpT8onfrDdHgn1G4Ll8kH1o5_OcQ3Vluzhh6Hs.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9icnlhbmtyYWhuLmNvbS9ub3QtYS1tb3RpdmF0aW9uLWlzc3VlLyIsInIiOiIwNmZiMWFmNi05MzgxLTQ0ZjktZjgyYS0xNjBmNmExZjAwZDAiLCJtIjoibHAifQ)

### (5 minute article) 

It feels like things have been out of control recently.

Between work, errands, and the upcoming holiday season- things are piling up. That's when it becomes really hard to get myself to exercise. It's easier to just stop and do nothing instead.

But I notice that when I do that, I just end up feeling worse.

### Admit you're overwhelmed and pull back

If I have a lot to do, I can either:

-   Try to force and 'motivate' myself
-   Pull back and reduce my work load

I noticed I tend to always rely on the first one.

### Focus on starting, not on completing

When I feel overwhelmed, I always end up freezing up.

There's too much to do, and I feel like I'll never get it done. The best trick I have at point is to encourage myself to just get started. To do something instead of nothing. Besides, most of the benefits already can be experienced in the first few minutes of exercise.

The trick is to get started.
