# My writing (250-300 words)

A concept that I came across from Precision Nutrition is the idea of a user manual.

The role of a good coach would be to make themselves useless

By helping a person build their user manual.

John Berardi
- collects information
- Make hypothesis, collect data,
- Review data, make decisions
- Increase self awareness
- Put yourself in charge
- You get to take responsibility for your own training
- Know how to adapt
- And no need to blindly follow
