# Learn how trust works with a simulation

I know that I'm a people pleaser and an avoider, so when it comes to interacting with people, I'm afraid to get mad, correct, or 'punish.'

This is my reminder from Game Theory that in order for trust to work, there needs to be consequences for being a bad actor.

The concept of tit for tat and Nash equilibrium highlights the importance of strategic thinking and cooperation in various scenarios. It's not enough to be naive and blindly trust others, nor is it effective to be sinister and always act in self-interest. 

The key to success is finding a balance between the two by cooperating with others while also punishing those who betray that trust. Those who understand the importance of this balance are more likely to succeed in their endeavors, whether in business, relationships, or other areas of life. 

Ultimately, the ability to work collaboratively and hold others accountable is a valuable skill in any situation.
