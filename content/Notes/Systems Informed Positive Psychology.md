We propose that for Positive Psychology (PP) to mature as a field and sustainably build individual and collective wellbeing for current and future generations, there is a need to intentionally apply systems thinking, principles, and approaches to PP theories, research, interventions, and practices. We call this Systems Informed Positive Psychology (SIPP).

I find this concept fascinating. It's like the natural progression of positive psychologyâ€”constructing an environment where you can work on happiness more easily.

The SIPP perspective, which has a shared purpose, draws on systems principles, and makes several philosophical assumptions, all of which are interconnected with the self, others, and society.
