### Key Idea

Our brains are wired to remember bad experiences in more vivid detail than positive experiences. Evolutionarily speaking, this makes sense. If walking down a specific side of the mountain to look for food meant running into that same damned bear we had last time, we’d better remember

but if someone who follows you calls you a retard you’ll probably remember it — and dwell on it.

I can link this to [[Notes/Chronic Pain]] and why it's easy for pain to stick
