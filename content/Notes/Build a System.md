# My writing (250-300 words)

Somehow, Stephen King can write a book a year.

He makes it look so effortless. Whenever I try to write, it seems like so much pain. It's hard and it's difficult. So the question is- how does he do it? The first myth to break is that it's willpower that's being used here. But that cannot be the case

Willpower works in the short term- but it has to be balanced with a good system.

--

Use your willpower to set up a system, instead of working out

Then you can focus on just showing up. It's a lot easier to just show up- instead of having to guess every time what you're supposed to do. If every day you're trying to figure out what to do for that day- it gets harder.

It's like when you want to write- but you can only focus on your writing system- not on the writing itself. Those are two different things.

There are two minds here. The writing mind & the editing mind. The mover mind & the coaches' mind
