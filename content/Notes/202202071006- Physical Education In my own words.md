# My writing (250-300 words)

P.E. in schools is completely wrong.

All the focus goes into how good you are at sports. There's no focus on how the body actually works. In the end, the 'good' ones get better, and the others feel left behind.

P.E. should be more about understanding your body in all its aspects

Instead of doing sports, what if PE was about how sleep and nutrition works? What if PE was about exploring how your body moves? What if PE was about learning to build good habits?

Focus more on learning the general principles of physical health
