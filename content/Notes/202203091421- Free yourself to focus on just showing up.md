# My writing (250-300 words)
Working out now is hard

Because when I was an athlete, the only thing I had to worry about was showing up. And that was so much easier. I got further and I did better knowing that there was someone taking care of me

Someone was doing all the thinking. And I trusted my coach to get me to where I wanted to go. My job as an athlete was to show up and be consistent, and put in the time.

That's why having a coach was so easy and stress free for me.
