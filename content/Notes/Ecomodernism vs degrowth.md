### Key Idea

‘ecomodernism’ before but didn’t pay much attention until a few weeks ago when I saw an explainer from TABLE, the successor to the Food Climate Research Network of the University of Oxford, and a joint project between the University of Oxford, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and Wageningen University and Research.

But I find the concept to be quite self-centered and I just don’t have the same confidence that technology will save us.
