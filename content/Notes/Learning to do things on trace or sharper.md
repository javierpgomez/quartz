# Why I'm Learning to do things on trace or sharper


## Context
Because we want to design it well
and design it ourselves

## What is it

It's this app where I can plan and sketch

## Why is it important

Because planning matters
And getting some ideas is good

Doing things yourself
It's about empowerment
It's about autonomy

It's about independence
and making smart choices
Having the freedom to choose
and to be smart

While working with people

## How can I implement it

Practicing a bit a day

This is something I'm practicing on Morpholio Trace

I should start by measuring how far apart the trees are

This one is about making a plan.
implementing the things we learned
