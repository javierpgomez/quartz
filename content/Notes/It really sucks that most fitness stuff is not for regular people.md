# It really sucks that most fitness stuff is not for regular people

You have to be super fit

or the content just seems like it's for non regular folk.

Every dude on instagram that I see can do a fucking handstand.
And that's fine.
It's okay because I like seeing strong bodies in motion

But that's not my body.
and i'm not really able to do that also.

So it's not for me.

## What do I want to see

I want to see content that helps me
It's regular person content I guess?
It's something that I can relate to?

It's content where I can apply it right away
