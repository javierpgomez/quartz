### Key Idea

We are not intolerant
We are just running out of processing power

There's too much to think about and too much to know

preferred because it truly burns more energy uh an energy savings than human trade. Right? So, uh I often make the comment that people are not more intolerant, they are just running out of processing power per day more than anybody else in the humanity ever did. So it's not unusual to like authoritarian leaders because I can't process all this information. So we are not away. Speaker 1: That that the super interesting. Sorry, I I didn't mean to interrupt you there. And but you you said something, I think I've never heard it put that way, we're not less intolerant than we were before. We're just running at a processing power.
