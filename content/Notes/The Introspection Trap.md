We basically think that introspection will automatically give us the answers we need, and we go for the most obvious answers â€” the ones that feel simple and plausible. This often results in [confirmation bias](https://nesslabs.com/confirmation-bias), our natural tendency to interpret and remember information in a way that confirms our prior hypotheses or personal beliefs.

That's interesting because when you're introspecting it's always just you- you're never thinking with other people. Or at least you usually aren't. 

But you should think about doing it that way. Because connecting to people and introspecting can give you some really really powerful ideas

And it can help you see other perspectives

That reminds me the need to [Find a self reflection process that works for you](Notes/Find%20a%20self%20reflection%20process%20that%20works%20for%20you.md)

Because introspection doesn't happen automatically. But you can build up a system so that you do it. And when you do find a system for that, you need to be able to balance it with other people too.

But the game-changing idea is that we tend to think of introspection as a solitary process. but it might make more sense to think of it as a group or community activity

This matters because if we are to really break through our thinking and become more introspective, we need to bring in other perspectives.
