# Computer and Human thinking

The best kind of work is when we let two kinds of thinking complement each other
Computer thinking and human thinking

A computer is good at grinding.
A computer has the time that we don't

We can let the computer spit out a solution
But instead of just copying it 
(that's cheating in chess)
We try to understand why is this good?

Then we try to be creative
Are there situations where this is not good?
Where can I learn from this?
