# Trees to the North

In temperate places this will block out the sun.
Here in the Philippines

Summer Solstice sun at noon is at 80 degrees
That's practically overhead
So there really is no way to block out all this sun

Some trees that are super close to the house on the north side?
A structure to trellis above the house?
