# Momentum

## Source:
- ??

## Key Ideas:
- In Physics, momentum is mass times velocity. That means if an object is bigger it has more momentum. If an object is smaller it has less. That's a fancy way of saying that if a train is moving moving at 50mph, that's much harder to stop than a baseball moving at the same speed.

- This can apply to if you want to keep your habits rolling. 
- If you've hit a critical mass by doing things a little bit at each time.
- Slowly building up that mountain then you're momentum will be much higher.
