# Changing the language of imposter syndrome 

Because calling it imposter syndrome sounds a bit negative
But maybe it's semantic

Imposter Syndrom is when confidence is lower than competence
It's the opposite of
[[Notes/Don't confuse rate vs actual knowledge]]]

If you have imposter syndrome
and your confidence is lower than your competence
It draws you to learn more
and it leads you to listen to other people

So overcoming imposter syndrome.
Is not really your goal

Because you always want to be listening and learning from others
It's a good virtue

## Language things

So the paradox is, if you're the right kind of learner- you'll always feel like an imposter
But that's not a bad thing

Because it means that if you're doing things in the right way
you'll always be wanting to learn and you'll always feel like you don't know enough
