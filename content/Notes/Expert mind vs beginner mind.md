# Expert mind vs beginner mind

## An analogy here

Zen 
Shunriyo Suzuki
In the experts mind there are many possibilites
In the beginners mind there are many

When someone was new to something
They wondered why couldn't it be this way

Jon Stewart
when he came into the daily show
Trevor Noah
when he come into the daily show

Newbies have ideas and expereinces 
that can bring fresh and new perspectives 
[[Notes/Try something weird to shake things up (Concept)]]
Beginners won't be as opposed to this

## My own experience

I feel like I sometimes trickle into expert mind thinking
But I want to keep beginners mind
