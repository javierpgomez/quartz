Somatic workouts, as one of the top trending fitness terms on Google in 2023, resonate deeply with my approach to fitness and health. These workouts prioritize the inner experience of movement, emphasizing not just physical form or strength but the emotional and physical sensations that accompany exercise.

At their core, somatic workouts involve a conscious practice of focusing on the internal experience of movement rather than its external appearance or result. This aligns with my belief in being fully aware and present during exercise. When I'm engaged in an intense workout, I ensure there are no distractions like screens or music. It's just me and the movement, deeply attuned to how each motion feels in my body.

Instructors like Jaycee Gossett of The Class and somatic movement educators like Sarah Warren emphasize this inward focus. The Class, for instance, uses music, movement, and breath to create sensations in the body and observe our thoughts. This approach not only fosters physical fitness but also contributes to spiritual and mental well-being.

Practicing somatic workouts involves tuning into body signals and sensations, a skill that may not come naturally but can be cultivated over time. Techniques such as closing eyes, moving slowly, and adopting an exploratory mindset can enhance this awareness. By removing the focus on end results like the depth of a squat, the practice encourages a judgment-free exploration of bodily sensations.

The benefits of somatic workouts extend beyond physical health. They offer a path to emotional release and self-discovery, improving emotional intelligence and energy awareness. As Gossett suggests, combining physical exercise with this deeper level of emotional understanding leads to a more holistic approach to fitness.

In essence, somatic workouts align with my personal fitness philosophy of being completely immersed and attentive to my body during exercise. They offer a unique opportunity to not only strengthen and tone the body but also to connect deeply with oneself, fostering a profound sense of bodily awareness and presence.
