# My writing (250-300 words)

One of the best things you can do for habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is normal

For me, in fitness, I was tired of
- Always competing and comparing myself
- Living in a culture of "no pain no gain"
- Doing shorts burts and burning out

I wanted something that was more long term. I wanted a group that had a philosophy of lifelong health. Something that could grow and adapt as I continued to learn about my body and myself.

In my case, I joined GMB fitness for that reason

In GMB I found people who were not only physically strong and agile, but who got there without beating their bodies into the ground. They were both skilled but also mindful when it comes to tackling long term health

And I grew into that mindset too thanks to them
