# The History of Fitness

This would be kind of interesting to explore.
But not quite there yet

I wonder if there are weird Victorian Fitness models
Or back into Soviet era
Or American manuals

I think about the french thing
where they won a lot of the olympics

I was coaching Diego yesterday
and I noticed there's a bias towards explosive lifts
which is a bias towards power lifting and olympic lifting
