*Get Stronger from stressors!*

Obi-Wan Kenobi's quote from Star Wars always reminds me of Antifragility:

> *"If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."* 

In a sideways way, this ties into the metaphor of the phoenix being reborn from the ashes of the dragonâ€”and of the hydra having its head cut off, only to have two replace it. 

Using alliteration, it's: getting **stronger from stressors**, more settled from shaking, more adaptable from attacks.

In a way, antifragility is a faster form of Natural Selection.

Antifragility is closely related to resilience/robustness, although resilience shouts *"Still standing after stressors!"*

This is better than the belief that we have to protect things from stressors!

It makes more sense to make things antifragile instead.

### Antifragility in the body and in fitness

We have this belief that if we get injured, we're irreversably damaged. But the body has antifragility built into it. 

Muscles get stronger when we work them out and tear them. 

### Antifragility in the mind

Right now I think of this mostly with students
and how they're so fragile
and they're so quick to not be resilient

### Antifragility in materials and repairing things

Everything needs work to maintain

But are you "maintaining" just to keep the status quo or as you repair and fix things it's actually growing and changing and adapting in the process?

Here's a fantastic image on how these systems work.

"Use it or lose it" is a good way to think about it
As you start
It slowly grows
It compounds

## An antifragile note system

I'm doing a note system that doesn't decay
That as I use it, it becomes better and more useful
Instead of something that becomes deteriorated as it gets used more

## Homesteading Cast Iron

I think the Cast Iron is an amazing example of this
That as you use it and care for it
It gets better instead of worse

The violin?
The teapot?

There are several things I think that fit under this category

## Antifragile and personalized

Maybe it's something that becomes more linked to you
It's antifragile because as you use it, it becomes more linked to your own style and personality
So it fits you more and more.

## Aim for antifragile systems

So that's what it comes down to
Thinking of systems and things that are antifragile

The problem for example with a capitalist kind of thinking
Is that these items are not antifragile enough
As you use them, they deteriorate
and then things just decay

and it's over. It's useless
and you throw it away
