In a world that increasingly gravitates towards digital immediacy, the humble postcard endures as a relic of tangible connection. "Dunya Mikhail — Eva Whose Shadow Is a Swan" captures this beautifully with its story of a decades-long friendship maintained through postcards. The act of sending and receiving these cards transforms into a ritual that's akin to a silent language—each card serving as a tiny vessel for emotion, memory, and the palpable feel of a distant friend's hand. Waiting for the card, holding it, and the thrill of its unpredictable arrival are experiences that digital messages can't replicate. The paradox lies in its beautiful inefficiency, where the length of time it takes for the card to travel physically magnifies the emotional weight it carries. Moreover, postcards can serve as a physical record, a tangible memory, a slice of one's past that digital ephemera can't replace. In a way, these postcards can be our modern-day "Babylonian tablets," waiting to be discovered, interpreted, and valued by generations to come.
