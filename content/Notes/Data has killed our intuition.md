Today no one can make a decision without consulting data.

Three major trends have led us to where we are today: 
- dramatic improvements in technology, 
- the over reliance on reason, and 
- the ever-increasing pool of choices.

Science may give us a logical answer, but we have to use our intuition to weigh it against the reality of our world.

I find this interesteing because many people are still afraid to trust they're intuition. 

I think it comes from fear of failure and the desire for certainty. We want to be 100% sure we are making the right decision.

But no system of knowledge is perfect, and it's important to practice [[Notes/Knowing the pros and cons of data]]

My concern is that reliance data seems to be a way to renounce responsibility. 

I like to tell on myself, that when I drive I'll ALWAYS rely on Waze, or Google Maps. And not because it's the most efficient route-- many times it isn't, and a smart driver familiar with the local area could do better.

But I like to follow what the technology says because I don't have to take responsibility for the outcome. If we're late or delayed, it's Google's fault.

If I outsource my decision making, I can say it's not my fault. 
I never make a mistake

But it's important to know how to balance these two things.

There is a tension between:

and
