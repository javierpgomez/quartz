Tell me the story
83kg
to 73kg
to 87kg

Going down 10kg is no joke!
How did that happen?

Getting up?
What do you think happened?

Going back down?
14kg?
10kg?

You mentioned running in the chat
Is this treadmill?
Do you have an exercise practice?

Realistic + sustainable (~2-3kg a month)
so for a 10kg goal
that's 3 months of work

It's sleep + Stress
Diet
Then exercise

How will we know you've hit your goal?
What's our measurement?

How would you like your check ins?
- email?
- messages?
- calls?

Pricing!! How to do pricing
Right now,
I'm working with Mark for 2500 a month ($50)
T.Sandra for 2500 a month ($50)
and Boo for 5000 a month ($100)

12 weeks
- 15000

How irresitable is this?

"I think I'll start with just one month at a time- I want to see if this is for me."
Sure! You can upgrade anytime to the full package anyway.

I'm very confident you can do this!
You have the awareness muscle!
You you just need to support
