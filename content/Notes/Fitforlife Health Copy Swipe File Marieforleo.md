 She draws you in with free resources and big, bold call-to-action (CTA) buttons.

-   **Empathy:** Picture your audience. What are their pain points? Use ‘you’ rather than ‘me’ or ‘I’. Tell them a [story that creates a bond](https://smartblogger.com/pointless-stories/) to make them feel understood and valued.
-   **Social proof** **and authority:** This is a trust building technique. Use customer testimonials, and showcase relevant experience, skills, or qualifications.
-   **Call to Action:** Move visitors through the site with helpful CTA buttons like Maria’s: ‘Download’, ‘Watch Now’, and ‘Get Inspired’.
