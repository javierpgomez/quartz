# My writing (250-300 words)

Don't think of health and coaching as a one-way street

The best health and coaching relationships are where both sides cooperate in order to get the results. 

It's not just the coach telling you what to do all the time. And it's not just you telling the coach what to do all the time.

It's not all just a passive thing. There is a real active component to the entire process.

This is why it's a positive sum game.

When you coach someone, you learn from them, and they learn from you. 

It's that thing teacher's say about how when you teach, you are the one who benefits the most from it
