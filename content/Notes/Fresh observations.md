# Fresh observations

One of the key ideas here is being able to capture quick observations.
Something that you can do now and then come back to right away

Quick notes
- in an app
- a notebook
- Something that you can do very voice

A Voice recording
- a quick audio snippet of what's on your mind

A video recording
- Like a little tik tok of your thoughts
- capture and move on

Having a capture habit for fitness
- Capture ideas quickly.
- and then synthesize that at the end of the day

Data gathering apps are going to be very helpful for this
But also note taking apps work really well too
