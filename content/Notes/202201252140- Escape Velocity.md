# My writing (250-300 words)

When NASA launches their spaceships, they use most of the fuel just to get the thing of the ground.

This is because all the hard work is gaining enough speed and momentum in order to break through the force of gravity. Inertia is a powerful thing

Same thing when it comes to habits. Inertia works the same way. It keeps you strapped to your couch and chair, and it's SUPER hard to get started

The good news is that's the hardest part. Getting started

Practice showing up, and accept that it will be hard to start. But don't worry, as it goes on- it will get easier and easier each day
