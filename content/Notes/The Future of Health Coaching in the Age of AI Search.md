The landscape of search engine optimization (SEO) is shifting significantly as AI-powered responses become increasingly prevalent in top-of-funnel queries. One might think this is only relevant for techies or marketers, but the ripple effects will surely reach health coaching as well. How? Let's consider a few things.

Firstly, AI is not just changing how people search; it's changing what they find. Generic glossary terms or FAQs about health, wellness, and exercise are likely to be auto-generated by AI, replacing the traditional search results. This presents a challenge but also an opportunity for health coaches.

**Growth hacking** our way through this new landscape will require a shift in approach. No more flowery language to fill the page. The content needs to be **straight to the point**, with **shorter paragraphs and lists** to facilitate easy digestion—no pun intended.

What's more, highlighting key elements such as contact details or special offers becomes even more critical. These are the "expiration dates" and "phone numbers" of the health coaching world. In this digital age, your online presence isn't just a business card; it's a living, breathing entity that needs to adapt, or risk being replaced by a machine.

And here's the kicker from my own musings: AI's role in transforming searches can either be a threat or a tool. If we understand its mechanisms, we can not just adapt, but get ahead of it. By adding a personal touch to our services—something AI can't replicate—we could give ourselves a competitive edge.
