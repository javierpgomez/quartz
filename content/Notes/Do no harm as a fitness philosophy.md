### Key Idea

Fitness should be about improving your health and quality of life, not putting yourself in danger. The best way to achieve this is to focus on doing no harm. 

This doesn’t mean you have to avoid all physical activity – in fact, regular exercise is essential for good health. But it does mean being mindful of the risks involved in any activity and taking steps to minimize those risks.
