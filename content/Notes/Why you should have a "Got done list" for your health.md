## Why you should have a "Got done list" for your health

Whenever I think about health, it's always about what I **should do**

-   I should go for a daily walk
-   I should eat well
-   I should eat some balanced meals

Just yesterday, I missed my morning exercise.

My car wouldn't start, so I had to call someone to do some repairs. I hoped it wouldn't take long, but I ended up losing most of the day.

I couldn't really work. I couldn't exercise. I could just wait.

With every hour, I could feel myself getting more and more frustrated.

By the time I got back home, it was too late too exercise.

It left a bad taste in my mouth.

When I shared my frustration with a buddy at the end of the day, he said:

## “Never mind what you didn’t do- what did you get done for your health today?”

That question brought me back to myself.

Yes, I was busy all day.

But when I looked for things I "Got Done" I could still name a few:

-   I got a lot of steps from pacing around just waiting
-   I was well hydrated yesterday
-   I actually had time to eat a meal slowly and mindfully.

We all have our “to-do” lists (for work, health, or our personal lives)

And it’s easy to focus on all those tasks looming over us. As human beings, we tend to focus a bit more on that side of things.

But there’s a benefit to a “Got Done” list

## A “Got Done” List lets us capture surprise wins

A lot of unexpected things happen throughout the day.

Problems pop up that need troubleshooting. A car breaks down. Or someone calls asking for help. Usually a lot of what we end up doing in a day wasn’t exactly what we planned when we got up that morning.

It’s good to ask then, “What did I get done for my health, considering all the unexpected surprised today?”

## A “Got Done” List can soothe the frustrations

This one is for the perfectionists

When there’s a big “to-do” list with a lot of items left on it, it can feel overwhelming and frustrating.

“I said I’d do a 1-hour walk today”  
“I didn’t even get to stretch today.”  
“I ordered out food again.”

Making a got-done list can help you feel less frustrated with not having done everything you set out to do.

Framing it as:

“I didn’t get to walk, but I was able to meditate for 10 minutes”  
“I didn’t eat great, but I stayed hydrated today”

Identifying those things can help you feel less annoyed and frustrated.

And that can give you a motivation boost to keep trying

## **How to Start a ‘Fitness Got-Done List’**

**Step 1:** Each morning, pick 1 thing that you’d like to do for your health today

**Step 2:** Look at your calendar. Note what you have scheduled and figure out when you can work on your health

**Step 3:** Throughout your day, be aware of other things you for your health. Write them down and check them off.

**Step 4:** In the evening, take a look at what you’ve done. Add anything that you want to try tomorrow. Celebrate your small wins.
