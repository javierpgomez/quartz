# Idea Name

### Context / Source
[[Notes/Where did PE go wrong?]]
[[466- The Weight]]

### Key Idea
Being fit is actually a matter of National Security

At least in the context of America, where they need young men to be able and conscriptable. 

And I can see how people still associate health with security. Think of things like the zombie apocalypse fitness idea. That I'm strong enough to survive the end of the world.

What if you think of health as something that's a peacetime reality?

Like instead of training and treating as if you could be called to war or survival mode anytime, what if you treated health like you would live a LONG time instead
