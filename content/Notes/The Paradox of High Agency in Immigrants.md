The act of immigration is often lauded as a hallmark of high agency. Adults who choose to immigrate are making a conscious decision to change their circumstances, admitting they were in the "wrong" place and taking the steps to start anew. This is a form of self-selection that arguably brings together individuals with higher levels of initiative and adaptability.

However, there's a darker underbelly to this narrative. Viewing immigration through the lens of high agency can be seen as a form of neo-colonialism. It assumes that the "best and brightest" are those who leave their native lands, potentially draining those countries of valuable human capital. This perspective can perpetuate a cycle where the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer, both in terms of countries and individuals.

For those whose parents were the immigrants, they are often raised in an environment that continually reminds them of their "luck" or "privilege." This can create a complex interplay of gratitude and pressure, which might influence their own sense of agency.

As someone deeply involved in the health and fitness sector, I can't help but think about how this concept of agency applies to personal transformation. Just like immigrants, individuals seeking to change their health status must admit they're in the "wrong" place and take steps to improve. But let's not forget, the journey is fraught with systemic challenges that can't be overcome by agency alone.

Understanding this nuanced view of agency can help us better navigate the complexities of human behavior, whether it's in the context of immigration or personal growth.
