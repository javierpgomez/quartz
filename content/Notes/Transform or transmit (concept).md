# Transform or transmit (concept)

Aka
Process or pass

This is a concept that I see in spirituality
and in addiction

That unless you're willing to deal with a difficult thing
it will always come back in one way shape or form.

And more seriously,
It is something that you will spread around to your neighbors
and to your loved ones
