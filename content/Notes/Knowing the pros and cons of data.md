### Key Ideas

When I work with clients, I always tell them that we will explore how data can help them and harm them. Having a “data expert” tell you that you don’t always have to use data to make decisions can be a relief. Many executives and companies are working themselves out, trying to justify every hunch or decision with numbers.

That's interesting because now everything is data driven, and people feel like there are no more choices to be made. They outsource everything to data science.

And of course it's good, but there must be moments when it's not as effective also.

That reminds me of [[Notes/Traditions usually exist for a reason]]

It's similar because in the same way that same traditions exist, and they become a source of wisdom, data is a legitimate source of wisdom too.

It's different because I think tradition is not as dismissive of data, but that's not always true. There's a lot of mistrust and skepticism on both sides

It's important because if we are going to move forward, we need balance- though in my opinion i would favor intuition.
