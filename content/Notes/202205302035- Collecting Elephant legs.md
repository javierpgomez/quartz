# My writing (250-300 words)

Using the story of the elephant and the big picture
Just hugging different parts of the big picture 

_"I'm collecting elephant legs"_

I'm just trying to understand a little more about the world.
And learn a thing or two along the way

It’s a nice way to talk about 
learning
being humble
accepting that you don’t know everything.
