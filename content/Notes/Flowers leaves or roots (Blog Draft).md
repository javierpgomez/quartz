# Flowers, leaves, or roots (Blog Draft)

## Key Idea

When growing plants you have to choose among these things

When we got our new calamansi plant, it was already starting to have a few fruits on it. But we were told
"If you pluck the fruit, magtatampo siya" (it will protest)
and not produce any fruit

I was so amused by that because it's one of those old folk wisdom kind of ideas
And I'm learning to respect and draw wisdom from [[Notes/The timing of festivals and dictating seasons]]

What's going on scientifically?

[[How plants direct their energy]]

The nutrients that each of those needs are 

Nitrogen for leaves
Phosphorous for Fruits
Potassium for Roots

And I know that by cutting one, the plant will focus on the other.
So if I want nutrients to go to roots (or to focus on roots)
I can trim to leaves?

Picking flowers
Pruning
Picking fruits
