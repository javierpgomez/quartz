When I first encountered the concept of "Building in Public," my immediate association was with audience engagement rather than marketing. It was eye-opening to consider that the underlying framework for building in public is actually all about marketing.

The marketing angle isn't simply a side effect; it's the central mechanism that drives this approach. Trustworthy brands aren't built in a vacuum. If what you're building doesn't gain traction, then the brand's trustworthiness becomes a moot point.

Here are some questions that come to mind:

- How could my current project benefit from a public building approach focused on marketing?
- What metrics could be used to measure traction effectively?

I've got to say, as a budding entrepreneur, this shifts the way I'll approach my public initiatives. I'm seeing it now: engagement is the means, but marketing is the end game. This realization opens up a whole new set of possibilities for how to strategize and make meaningful impacts.

The ultimate takeaway is that you can't separate marketing from the equation when you're building in public. If you do, you risk developing a brand that might be trustworthy but irrelevant due to a lack of visibility and traction.
