# MOCs encourage flexible non-destructive thinking
MOCs allow for flexible idea rearrangement because you can map the same bits of information in completely different ways.

Take a second to unpack what's going on here. This highlights a profound but under-appreciated aspect of MOCs. 

> MOCs allow for limitless interpretations. The only limit is your imagination.

Check out (3) extra MOCs below. They all use the exact same 19 concepts, but for different purposes. This type of awesome relational/positional thinking doesn't happen with a rigid table of contents.
