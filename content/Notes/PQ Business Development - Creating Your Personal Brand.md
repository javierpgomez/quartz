	- Is active and loves to move

**My favorite hero/heroine** (My purpose)

**I take a stand for** taking a hard journey. Going through a challenge and coming out on the other side better

**I am here to** show you that there is a great journey you can take, and it's full of ups and downs but it is great

**My life makes a difference by** guiding people on a brave (sometimes scary journey)

I am your guide on the journey of health. Health is a challenging journey, and many people feel lost (in a dark wood and uncertain place). But at the end of the journey, is a place of happiness ease and flow. Health feels scary, but it doesn't need to be- if you have a good guide!

3. I wish I could be as free and as detached as you
4. Relationship goals! (I can balance my health, my work, my profession and my relationships)
5. I explore and can just do things- I go on adventures!
