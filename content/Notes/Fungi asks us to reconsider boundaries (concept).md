# Fungi asks us to reconsider boundaries (concept)

## Source
- [[Entangled Life]]

## Key Ideas
- Because fungi aren't so clear cut, it's not clear where they start or end
	- With plants it's not clear where they start or end
- Like a blind man, and his walking stick
	- Isn't the stick an extension of his senses?
	- Where does that man start and stick end?
