**Avoid imposing advice or solutions**. Instead, guide them toward their own preferences and options. For example, if you want to help an employee overcome burnout by rekindling their motivation, you could say, “I know you are a creative person. In what ways could more creative or artistic assignments help you feel more excited about your role?”

It's better to give options. Though I think you should read the room.

Sometimes people just want to be told what to do. Freedom is hard! And [Learning to Discern for yourself](Notes/Learning%20to%20Discern%20for%20yourself.md) is not easy to do. But mature individuals can and should be able to do it.
