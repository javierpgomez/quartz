# My Canon of Books

I can try to identify my canon.
The books that really helped me.
And the ones that really changed my perspective

That I would keep coming back to

Dante
Spirituality of Imperfection
Merton New Seeds of Contemplation
Letters
Earthsea now more recently.

# What are the things that get better as you come back to them?

These are evergreens
Some ideas that are timeless

So there's classic stuff
But I like Pacific Rim
and Speed Racer.
and Thomas Merton stuff

# My Canon and Reading List

I listen to a lot of Thomas Merton
Which I like because I'm always trying to free myself

He speaks to me and resonates with me
He's not really mainstream
But I like the way her writes

It's penetrating

I like Frank Ambrosio

I like the Spirituality of Imperfection

There are Richard Rohr books I like

The twelve steps books speak pretty close to my experience
(Though not perfectly)
