### Key Idea

If you're looking for the most bang for your buck when it comes to training, split work training is the way to go. This type of training involves working different muscle groups on different days, so you're never overworking any one group.

Not only is split work training more effective than other methods, it's also more efficient. You can get a great workout in a shorter amount of time, which means you can spend more time doing the things you love outside of the gym.

If you're looking to get the most out of your training, split work training is the way to go.
