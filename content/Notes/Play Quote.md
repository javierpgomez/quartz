# Play Quote

“Play prepares people for an evolving planet”

This is great.
Because of that thing where you claim to teach people how to learn
Instead of teaching them the rules, or techniques

It's more about skills
[[Notes/Rules are necessary to start, but developing skills is the goal]]
and trusting yourself
and learning how to learn
[[Learning to Listen to your body]]
[[Notes/Learning to Discern for yourself]]

Play
