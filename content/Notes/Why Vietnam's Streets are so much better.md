Why Are Vietnam's Streets So Active? — The Homage Project

### Key Ideas

Vietnamese wisdom would suggest cities striving to stimulate their streets relax regulations, demand mixed-use developments, allow sidewalk eating, and most of all, embrace the seating, impromptu performances, and loitering of a proper, bustling street.

**Note:** This is why I like Vietnam and not Manila for example. It's not designed to be interfaced with

That's interesting because i think a healthy city is a walkable city. The less cars you see and interact with the better it is overall. And having the ability to just enjoy a city as a pedestrian is so rare

That reminds me [[Notes/Things are based in the physical (concept)]]

It's similar because it's about real places and the effect it has on real life connection

It's different because it's not just about walking

It's important because if we are to form communities and live healthy and happy lives, we need this kind of city connection
