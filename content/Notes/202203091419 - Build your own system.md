# My writing (250-300 words)

When you're starting out it's good to copy other people's systems

That's what internet programs are for. They're useful- they hit the basics. They can work- and they allow you to focus on just showing up

Then over time, you start to see the pros and cons of each system. That gets you thinking about how each system could be better

Then if you want you can move on to the next stage. You're not just doing programs. You're learning and experimenting. You're seeing what works for you. And then you're flying.

You can customize things for yourself
