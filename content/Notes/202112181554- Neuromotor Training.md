# My writing (250-300 words)

My favorite overlooked part of physical training is the 'neuromotor' side of it

What is neuromotor training you ask? An easy way to think about it is 'balance and coordination.' There's stuff that looks really strong like lifting heavy weights, but a lot of people overlook the coordination part.

It's also more practical for daily life

You're more likely to have to balance different objects and pick something up off the floor than you are to lift a super heavy weight off the ground. People just overemphasize strength and then completely overlook the coordination part

How can you get coordination in?
