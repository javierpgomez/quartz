In the realm of problem-solving, design thinking emerges as a beacon of clarity, transforming the intricate into the manageable. It's a strategic alchemy that distills down the chaos of "wicked problems"—those entangled issues that defy simple definition and resist straightforward solutions. These are the hydra-headed challenges where each solution seems to spawn new questions, making you wonder if you've even grasped the root cause.

In my journey, I've found solace in the orderly process of design thinking. It's a structured yet flexible framework that doesn't just confront complexity; it embraces it. Here’s my take: everything morphs into a design-thinking challenge, from the systemic puzzles of education to the deeply personal battle against postpartum depression. It is in this diversity of application where its true power lies.

Horst Rittel illuminated the path when he spoke of problems so tenacious and complex that they were dubbed "wicked." These aren't your garden-variety issues but rather the sort that intertwine with human unpredictability and societal structures. When facing such Goliaths, one learns quickly that the task isn't to find a silver bullet. Instead, we seek to navigate the labyrinth, to understand that the problem's definition evolves as we peel back layers, venturing deeper into the 'why' behind the 'what.'

I often reflect on this during my practice—recognizing that what makes design thinkers valuable isn't just their employability but their adaptability. They're the intellectual shapeshifters who can turn their hands to the diverse fabric of real-world issues, making them more employable, yes, but fundamentally, more equipped to enact meaningful change.

In this light, I see my environment as a living lab—a space where the design thinking methodology breathes life into static issues, viewing each challenge as an opportunity for growth. The optimism my students harbor is mirrored in my approach; there’s a buoyancy in knowing that each "wicked problem" is a chance to redefine the boundaries of what we think is possible.
