Do real things.](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/faNqF0ctq/c?w=EBx9tfaLPdb1S7moAOjq8e1zJQlwt9QYBZaUFkMpfgA.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3V0c2lkZW9ubGluZS5jb20vaGVhbHRoL3dlbGxuZXNzL21lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtYmVuZWZpdHMtZ3JvdW5kZWRuZXNzLyIsInIiOiIwNmZiMWFmNi05MzgxLTQ0ZjktZjgyYS0xNjBmNmExZjAwZDAiLCJtIjoibHAifQ) (4 mins)

Last year, I got into woodworking for this first time.

And each time I build something, it wouldn't go according to plan. I would sketch something out, choose and cut the wood, and then assemble it. Almost always something was a bit off- and I would find different ways to fix it.

I didn't have to wonder if I did a good or bad job- the results were clear to see.

### Find a real activity with real results

Like woodworking, there are many activities that scratch this itch. 

And we're starting to understand all the benefits of these activities.

Today, more and more of our work is conceptual- and very subjective.

Coaching can be one of them. It's hard to tell if I'm doing it well. Same thing with being a team manager, or a corporate CEO. When things don't work- you can talk your way out of it and explain what went wrong.

But real activities with real results give it to us clear.

### Real Activities help us feel grounded, calm, and can help reduce pain

All sorts of activities count here- even things like knitting and crafting.

It's that feeling when the world just slips away, time slows down and you can fully immerse yourself in what you're doing.

Real activities can get us into the flow state consistently.
