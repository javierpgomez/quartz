#### Learning Through Movement

It's an easy assumption to make—that reasoning is purely a function of the mind. However, compelling insights from the article "How to Reason With Your Body" as well as figures like George Soros and Einstein challenge this notion. They introduce the idea that **kinesthetic awareness**—the physical, bodily understanding of the world around you—is not just useful but essential for robust reasoning and problem-solving.

Einstein and Soros exemplify this kinesthetic awareness in their respective fields. Soros, for instance, claimed that his back would "act up" if something were wrong in the markets. A bodily signal as a barometer for external events? Fascinating. It almost suggests that our bodies might be more attuned to the nuances of our environment than we give them credit for.

#### The Feeling of Thinking

I've noticed that when I move—when I physically engage with the world—my thinking becomes richer, more nuanced. I 'feel' my way through problems, just as the speaker in the article described. My body becomes an active participant in the process, a contributor to the "thinking," if you will. For me, this isn't about relegating cognition to some cerebral ivory tower; it's about incorporating the full experience of being a living, moving being into how I approach the world.

#### The Spectrum of Awareness

The idea here isn't to downplay intellectual or cerebral reasoning. On the contrary, it's about recognizing that reasoning exists on a spectrum that involves the whole body. You don't have to be 'all in your head' or 'all in your body.' A balanced approach yields a more holistic understanding of challenges and opportunities.

#### Expanding the Toolbox

This concept of "reasoning with the body" encourages us to expand our toolbox of cognitive strategies. If bodily signals can help Soros gauge market shifts, or help Einstein understand the workings of the universe, just think what integrating bodily awareness could do for your decision-making and problem-solving.
