# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

Referees are supposed to be nuetral people

The problem:
it's such a thankless job
There's no one who will thank you when you do your job well

And so if you find happy refs
That's a red flag

That probably means something is up
and that something has gone wrong in the system
