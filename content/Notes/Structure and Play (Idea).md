# Structure and Play

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

There was a study recently that compared the play habits of children

They observed that for some kids, structured play works better for them. But there are other kids for whom freedom and no rules play worked better. What does this mean for you? This means that you should take into account freedom and structure when you move

Are you a freedom person? Or are you a structure person?
