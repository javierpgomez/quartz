# My writing (250-300 words)

Sometimes we fall into this trap of requiring pure motivation

"I have to enjoy running for its own sake"
"I have to like workout out for its own sake"

I have a client who can only get himself to run on a treadmill if he puts a Netflix show on at the same time. When he sheepishly admitted this to me, I said "But what's wrong with that?"

"I think it's great that you're moving, and that you've found a way to help you move more"

Let's dispel the notion that we have to have pure motives all the time (maybe one day it will come)

But for now, move as much as you can- and motivate yourself to move in whatever way motivates you.

Don't obsess over 'perfect motivation'
