In the quest to become a thought leader, the acronym F.A.T. serves as a compelling framework. It stands for Following, Authority, and Transparency. Each element is crucial, and the absence of even one can derail your journey from being a mere influencer to a key opinion leader.

Authority is my strong suit. With years of experience and expertise, I've built a solid foundation. However, transparency is the missing puzzle piece in my thought leadership journey. It's akin to having a well-stocked library but keeping it locked away from the public. What good is knowledge if it's not shared openly?

The concept of "escape velocity" is intriguing. It's the point where you've gained enough momentum in two distinct streams that you can create something entirely new. Think of Scott Adams, who blended business acumen with cartooning to create a unique voice. It's like hiking two different trails and discovering a hidden path that connects them, offering a new perspective that only you can provide.

For me, the challenge lies in being more transparent about my learnings and experiences. Transparency isn't just about openness; it's about vulnerability. It's about sharing not just the polished final product but also the messy, complicated process that led to it. This is where I need to focus my efforts.

This matters to me because I realize that authority without transparency is like a locked treasure chest. The value is there, but it's not fully accessible. To truly achieve "escape velocity" and create something of unique value, I need to embrace transparency as much as I've embraced authority.
