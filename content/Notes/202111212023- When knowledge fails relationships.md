# My writing (250-300 words)

My wife is not the woman I thought she was

I think I know my wife. I think I know my friend. The worst thing it turns out is to think that I've got this person all figured out. That I can predict her behavior. That I know everything about her. And that's when I'm in trouble. The person is always more.

My wife is the woman she is. That's better than who I thought she was

The worse mistake you can make is to think you've got it figured out

That's when you can get surprised. And when you get surprised, you have to make a choice. Am I going to choose the person in front of me? Or am I going to choose this ideal version of this person? That I wish she was more like this or more like that?

The person is always greater than the knowledge of the person
