This has to do with the copy & paste effect. Cities are all beginning to look the same. New buildings are basically copy and pasted. The result is you enter a sea of sameness. Whereas cities used to be as unique snowflakes (think the streets of Paris), today many of them are being robbed of their individuality. The feeling is a bunch of placeless places.

Why fast food? Well, fast food is something that is convenient and tastes good in the moment. But once you start driving home, you start feeling the effects. That KFC isn’t sitting well. Fast food content. Fast food cities. The rise of standardization.

Examples include farmers markets booming, vintage shopping booming, shopping local is booming and community-based brands like Rapha are taking off.

TLDR; you not just buying a cycling jersey, you’re buying into a cycling community
