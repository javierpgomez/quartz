# It's not the program, it's the system

Moving from program thinking
to systems thinking

## Analogy
This is like a recipe
and the principles of cooking
[[Notes/Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat (Story)]]
The only book that really helped me think about cooking well.
Not recipes but 
[[Notes/First principles (concept)]]

So build a system
and understand the first principles
((Is this the course?))
