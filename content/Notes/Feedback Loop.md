*"The more you feed me, the more I feed you."*

"A feedback loop occurs in nature when the product of a reaction leads to an increase in that reaction."

A powerful concept because it goes cross disciplines.

It's in psychology, the sciences, sociology, collective behavior, game theory, and all sorts of areas of life.

For me, it's most relevant when it comes to health and thinking. Because that's where bad habits can create feedback loops that are self destructive.

It's an entry point into understanding addiction, and how people get trapped in behaviors they don't really want to keep doing. 

I've heard someone use this [Unique Definition of Addiction](Notes/Unique%20Definition%20of%20Addiction.md)
*Addiction is a "Compulsion that persists in spite of negative health consequences"*

And that pretty much captures the idea of the feedback loop too
