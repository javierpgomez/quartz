When diets work for most people, it happens by accident.

They try out a diet- and it turns out to work for them. Then they start to think that it was the diet that worked- and it was the only thing that works. So each time they set out to accomplish the same goal, they try to replicate those exact same circumstances again.

But that's looking at the wrong thing. You're thinking that it's the diet itself that worked. But actually there are deeper elements at play here.

What you really want to do is consciously create your health

Understand the elements that work. And then see how each of those principles apply to different types of healthy practices. Try to go back towards the principles. That way you don't get distracted by different techniques, and you're always looking for the one thing. 

See how these elements are present in different activities, and then apply them.
