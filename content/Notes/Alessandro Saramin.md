Alessandro's goal
- have his training ready
Javier
- getting up the community 

Nervous about my call with someone
Having to say no is hard

When Alessandro did the pricing
- What about selling your program 
- $15 euros feel very low
- $5000 impossible
- $100
You don't know until you ask

It's important if it gives you what you want and what you need
- $4000 / 40 = $100

If enough people say yes, then that's a good price
- just try again
- and ask again
- and ask again

If the price feels right to me, then I will be more confident and honest when making the pitch.
