In the sphere of free speech and political correctness, the debates are strikingly cyclical, almost like a déjà vu of arguments from the 1990s. George Santayana's sage warning that "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" seems to manifest in these ever-recurring discussions.

In my experience, academia offers us a lens to study the subtle nuances and shifts in these debates over time. It's not that the arguments themselves are new, but the context around them—technological, social, or otherwise—may introduce additional layers or subtleties. This is the brilliance of academia; it allows us to remember and hopefully break free from these cycles.

It leads me to ponder: how do we ensure that these studies and discussions move us forward, rather than having us spin in circles? After all, if the purpose of studying history is to avoid past mistakes, are we failing if the same arguments resurface?

By bringing a historical perspective into current debates, we do more than just contextualize; we offer a roadmap for how to avoid retreading the same ground. It's not about stifling conversation but enhancing it by adding a layer of awareness that only comes from understanding our past.

It's essential to involve multiple perspectives in these discussions, both from academia and everyday experience. By combining these, we might escape the trap of cyclical debates and enact meaningful change.

It's worth noting that while the core of these debates may remain unchanged, the mechanisms through which they are discussed have evolved, mostly thanks to technology. This is a small step forward, but it's progress nonetheless.
