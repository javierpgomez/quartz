"I'd love to exercise again, but I'm afraid I'll do it wrong"  
  
Does this sound like you?  
  
One deep breath, here's what you need to remember:  
  
  
1️⃣ You don't need to be perfect to reap the benefits of exercise  
  
The big killer of routines is [#perfectionism](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=perfectionism&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7018400719774892033).  
  
If you try to be all-or-nothing, 95% percent of the time, you just end up doing nothing.  
  
So you missed a day?  
  
That’s fine! It doesn’t make you a bad person.  
It doesn’t mean you failed at health and exercise.  
  
It just means you missed a day!  
  
Now will you do something today?  
  
  
2️⃣ If it’s “wrong” your body will tell you  
  
Our bodies are amazing  
  
There’s a simple built in mechanism that will let you know what’s too much for you.  
  
That’s called “pain.”  
  
If something hurts, than don’t push through it.  
  
But don’t use painful sensations as an excuse to avoid exercising altogether.  
  
Start slow and work your way up.  
  
Our bodies have the ability to recover from almost anything.  
  
So give your body a chance to make slow and steady improvements.  
  
  
3️⃣ Build up trust, not fear  
  
There’s so much [#fear](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=fear&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7018400719774892033) around us today.  
  
Why?  
  
When you feel pain, you check online and it says “Here’s what’s wrong with your body.”  
  
Then you start to feel worried and afraid. That makes you exercise less  
  
How can you build up [#trust](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=trust&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7018400719774892033)?  
  
This is where a person comes in!  
  
We get information online, but we TRUST living breathing human beings.  
  
When a coach tells you- “Don’t worry, this movement is safe, and I’m watching you all the way.”  
  
That makes you feel secure.  
  
You loosen up. You’re less tense.  
  
You’re less likely to get hurt!  
  
  
If you’re afraid to exercise, that’s okay! Respect that fear, and then use the tips above to work through it
