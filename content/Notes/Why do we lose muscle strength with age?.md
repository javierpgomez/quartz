Unfortunately, the loss of muscle quality is inevitable, progressing intrinsically at the cellular level at [multiple steps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074082/) along the muscle contraction pathway. For instance, in older muscles, the excitation-contraction coupling becomes inefficient due to a decline in the number of calcium ion channels in the muscle fiber. Age is also associated with myosin structural changes that reduce its ability to remain in a strong-binding, force-generating state, so muscle contraction is weaker.
