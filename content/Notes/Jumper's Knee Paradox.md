# Jumper's Knee Paradox

The best athletes get jumper's knee more often.
Why is that the case?

Well, high performers tend to do more. Because they're the ones who are asked to perform more often.

So a high performer is way more likely to get overloaded in their bodies.
Then someone who may have a less strong knee, but doesn't have as strenous demands made on his body.
