### Key Ideas

Insecurity is a tough pill for many to swallow, but in the world of fitness, it’s **extremely common**—_it likely might just be the reason you started down this path._

1. Identify Negative Thoughts/Emotions About Your Body
2. Take The Emotion Out of The Thoughts
3. When You Identify These Thoughts, Reframe Them
4. Add Perspective & Gratitude To Your Reframe
5. Accept Yourself, How Far You’ve Come and How Far You’ll Go, & Believe You Can Make a Change

If I actually let that dictate how I viewed my self-worth, I would go insane. Instead, as cliche as it sounds, I focus on 1 thing: Being better today than I was yesterday, and being better tomorrow than I was today! DO NOT COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS, YOUR ONLY COMPETITION IS YOU AND BECOMING BETTER!
