### What’s the subject area for your book? Where would it be in the bookstore? You can change it later if you’re not sure. Just list your best guess.

### What are the repeating messages for books in your field? Come up with at least 3 or 4 bullet points.

### What’s missing? Just keep it really simple with short phrases, listing as many as you can.

### In what ways does this passion of yours inform and influence your book idea?

I have always been curious and passionate about **Lifelong Movement** which is about **creatively staying active year to year** I care about **Moving for life** because **I myself want to be able to stay active and energetic even when I’m old and gray**

### What’s your counter-intuitive idea? What can you distill down into a single sentence or phrase? Just jot down a bunch of half baked ideas and see where that gets you.

For instance, my first book’s counter-intuitive message was: Divorced families can actually be healthier for kids than nuclear families (where the mom and dad are still married but miserable). That was my hook, and I opened with it when I pitched literary agents to get their attention.
