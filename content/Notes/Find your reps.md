The core idea here is: What is the number of reps that will support me for consistency? Instead of focusing on big and ambitious (often unrealistic goals). Instead, realize that [Small decisions actually make a huge impact](Notes/Small%20decisions%20actually%20make%20a%20huge%20impact.md)

Saying I'll write a 20,000 word essay is so unweildy.

But by trusting in the [Compounding effect](Notes/Compounding%20effect.md). And taking small actions repeatedly until it hits critical mass can get you to where you want to be.

I never considered mysefl much of a writer, so I started very small- with tweets. Write 240 characters everyday and tweet it out.

Then I started adding onto that as I got better, smarter, and 'stronger' about writing. It's like lifting weights and going to the gym.

But the trick is finding the amount of reps (or the progression) that works for the stage that you are in now.
