While it is easy for city dwellers to call everyone else unsophisticated, it is plain to everyone else that people who spend their lives as city dwellers tend to collect neuroses.

I'm not really a city person. And I can see the paradox.

Living in the city is an efficient life. Resources are near. You can serve people better if they live close together.

Think about how a good walkable city is great for health, and for distribution of goods.

Meanwhile living out in the country is a bit resource intensive. You definitely need a vehicle. You may have to stock up.

The way to live healthily in a city is to have country-dwelling friends or relatives and visit them often.
