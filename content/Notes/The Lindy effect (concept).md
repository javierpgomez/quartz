## The Lindy effect (concept)

Counter intuitive

But it talks about classics
And why somethings last

This is related to inertia

It sounds like something like 
Things that have been around for a while are here to stay

So it says ignore fads
Or give them time


## Problem
But how does it deal with the fact that conventional wisdom can be wrong.
