I saw a recent case study where programmers were using ChatGPT to help them write their code for the programs. It was called GitHub CoPilot.

GitHub CoPilot is the first large-scale AI use case that has significant tractionâ€”reportedly writing 40% of the code for developers who use it. 

Eventually, you can imagine that there's a co-pilot for every profession. Microsoft is building an AI copilot into Office. Diagram is building a copilot for designers. The list goes on.

That's interesting because it's curious to see how people think AI will replace / complement / augment our efforts as humans.

That reminds me of [this article I read](https://www.fastcompany.com/90863983/chatgpt-medical-diagnosis-emergency-room) where a doctor used ChatGPT to help him diagnose his patients in the emergency room. (Spoiler alert: it didn't work perfectly - no surprise). But this isn't to accept or dismiss the outcome from the get go. It's more useful to think about why something works, and how it could be better in the future.

Personally, I don't feel threatened by AI at all- but I do worry that people (who don't know any better) will stop seeking professional help when they 'feel' like an AI can do just as good of a job.

More time is needed to make it clearer
