### Key Idea

Sports is so high profile. It's part of society, and so it is necessarily political. It is subject to the same expectations of fairness, and equality. So we should not be silent.

We should be aware of the implications of what we do, and how it is received. We should also be willing to have difficult conversations about the role of politics in sports.

 Sports can be a unifying force, but only if we are willing to have the tough conversations about the role of politics in sports. Let's not be silent. Let's have the tough conversations.
