### Why I had to change my workout

A few days ago, [I tweeted](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/dfNk5M7yc/c?w=a-ZvVkgZevbC3mZrBVhcBdxIm_amKIYCi2MVS4OW4eE.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9KTFBHb21lei9zdGF0dXMvMTQyOTY5MDkxNTg3NTA4MjI0MiIsInIiOiI5MjlmNjc1Ny1kMjYxLTQ4ODktMDVkOC1kYmEyM2QyYzg1NzQiLCJtIjoibHAifQ)Â about how my fitness routines have changed in the years since I was a varsity athlete.

Once my competing days were done, it was hard to shift down into a different kind of fitness routine. All I knew was how to push my body to its limit. Let's just say that got my into more injuries than I'd like to admit.

These days, I have a few rules for myself when it comes to staying healthy. It's helped me transition into my post-competitive life better.

### 1. It's okay to do the bare minimum

Some days are just so busy. And as much as I would love to have time to go on long runs or hit up the gym, I just can't. So I'm practicing [establishing a minimum workout](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/dfNk5M7yc/c?w=sF-Of_msq5shKc6V88lYm1XFH9zqeQFU0vcnsNvwrAs.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZml0Zm9ybGlmZS5waC9wb3N0L3RoZS1wcmluY2lwbGUtb2YtYS1taW5pbXVtLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS13b3Jrb3V0IiwiciI6IjUzMjIxMGZkLWVkYjctNGQ2ZC0yM2NlLWFhZTRhYTUzZjI4NCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9). And then not feeling so guilty when I have to resort to that.

### 2. Sneak in more activity

Another trick I like is finding ways to get a little bit more physical activity throughout the day. Standing desk is the classic example of this. My personal fave is using a basket instead of a cart when grocery shopping. (I gotta carry it around + I end up buying less).

### 3. Stop Comparing Myself to Myself

Maybe the hardest one for me, but I find I'm always thinking back to how fit I used to be back then. Whenever my mind gets into that headspace, I try to snap back to the present, and try my best to appreciate where I am now.
