I’ve had a nagging feeling that I should learn more about the physical and mechanical terms that get thrown around in business. So I picked up—and have been devouring—a book called [The Way Things Work](https://every.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) by David Macaulay.

That's interesting because physical principles explain a lot about how the world. And at the end of the day, you cannot break the laws of physics. Food still needs to be grown. Electronics, AI, Cloud Computing all rely on electrical or quantum principles. The universe still has rules.

That reminds me of [First principles (concept)](Notes/First%20principles%20(concept).md). Understand first principles and you'll be completely fine! Or at least you'll know how to think.

It's important because a lot of tech people or entrepreneurs like making sky high promises without even understanding the real physical limitations of their product. You can only distort reality so much.

Some things have to be based in reality
