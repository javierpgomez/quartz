# Different Types of Tomato Varieties

## Context

Planted some tomatoes
didn't really study
Turns out there are different varieties

## What is it

All I learned is that there are determinates and indeterminates
Determinates are the ones that grow to a fixed height and fruit at a certain time
Indeterminates can just go on and on until the season ends
