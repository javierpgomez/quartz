# Be gentle with plant roots

When I [[Notes/Transplanting my calamansi (Blog post)]]
I wasn't very gentle
I think I was drastic
Because it was coming from a bad situation
And I felt like I had to clean the roots

So to leave alone?
Or to wash clean?

It depends.
Clean if it's overgrown
Trying to get it into the landscape
If it's root bound

But you still have to be gentle naman
Well it does slow down the growth

But I think for trees
(Perennials)
I'm more interested in their long term health

Whereas annuals I can see that you'd like to maximize it in the year that it's there
