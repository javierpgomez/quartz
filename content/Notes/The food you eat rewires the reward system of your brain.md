An original indigenous diet would have been super bland. So bland that a modern person would not be able to partake of it at all.

We probably wouldn't even last a single week. Because our reward circuits now are so different that it's hard to imagine how it would be.

So it's like a sugar cane or something where you suck out the nutrient but you're spitting out the pure insoluble fiber. 

And so they're not sitting there sauteing onions on the stove, they're not putting sauces, they're not spicing, they're just taking food out of nature and cooking it and eating it. 

It's just a radically different type of diet than we're accustomed to. 

I think in this regard it's interesting to consider how reward circuits adapt to that. 

Basically our brains are set up to not be satisfied with ordinary stuff once we have gotten a taste of more modern food
