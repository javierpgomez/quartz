# My writing (250-300 words)

The smarter you are the more likely are you to think that you're unbiased 

And you have higher regard for yourself

Because you're faster at recognizing patterns also

So you're definitely faster at stereotyping

Therefore, if you are smart, you are actually more likely to be biased, not less.

What does this mean? You should try to be as humble as possible
