Knowing your goal is not enough- do you have any idea how you'll get there?

That's why you need a roadmap. If you want to get to New York from Boston, there any different ways to get there. Depending on your situation, there are better or worse ways to get to where you need to be. So the goal is to figure out the best way to get there.
