In today's digital age, building trust is not as simple as being physically present with someone. 

With the rise of remote work and online communities, it's become more difficult to build trust without face-to-face interaction. However, the idea that trust is built on time still holds true. 

It takes time to get to know someone, to understand their values and beliefs, and to build a strong relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.

To build trust in a digital world, it's important to prioritize quality interactions over quantity. 

Instead of just trying to rack up hours of facetime, focus on having meaningful conversations and finding common ground with others. It's also important to be consistent in your interactions and follow through on your commitments to others. 

By investing the time and effort to build trust, we can create stronger and more fulfilling relationships, even in a digital world.
