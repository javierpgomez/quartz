The 'Sandwich Effect' in workout programs suggests a two-pronged approach for keeping clients engaged. The idea is to start each workout with a familiar routine, then end it with something that's either fun, easy, or engaging.

1. **Familiar Start**: Makes it easier for a client to get into the workout without much hesitation.
2. **Engaging Finish**: Plays on the recency bias, making the client more excited to return for the next session.

The insight here is simple yet profoundly effective. Familiarity at the start lowers the activation energy required to begin, and an engaging end leaves a lasting impression.

I have to say, this is a useful tip that could be a game-changer in how I design my fitness programs. It's about more than just the exercises; it's about shaping the client's experience from start to finish.

The 'Sandwich Effect' is a nifty way to leverage behavioral psychology to improve adherence and increase client retention. If you're not just filling the middle of the "sandwich" but paying equal attention to the "bread," you're likely to have a more complete and satisfying program.
