# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

Running a company is hard as hell. Even in good times, it can be a grind. Itâ€™s definitely critical to carve out personal time, but you should also think about ways to bring more of your life into your work. I like to think of it as work-life integration.
    - Note: This is where I'm struggling now. It's easier to be told what to do. It's much harder to go through it
