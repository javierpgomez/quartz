# My writing (250-300 words)
The idea is that each of our bodies are different, and while there are general rules about biology and chemistry about how the body will behave. Each of our bodies are also very unique and respond in different ways.

So I get this feeling that what I read doesn’t really apply to me.

I feel that sometimes I’ll train and train and I’ll move and move but it’s not clear what’s happening or what’s the next place to be. This way I can incorporate some kind of awareness.
