# Environmental reevaluation (concept)

The core idea here is
Considering how your behaviour affects others

This will help you behave in a way that hacks you
It's less about my own experience

And how about the people I care about

## Covid?

Wearing a mask?
Is that an example here. 
Even if I wouldn't weare one for myself
I would still do it because I want to protect other people

## Clarification

It's not about caring what other people think.
It's more like thinking about how I am affected and connected to other people
A more mycelial way of thinking perhaps?
[[Notes/The Mycelial person by Tim Ingold]]

## Quick example

Being a good example for your children
I want to think about how my behavior might affect them.
And how the consequences of my behavior extend past myself also
