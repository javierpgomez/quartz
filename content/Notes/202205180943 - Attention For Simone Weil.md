### Key Ideas

For Simone Weil, when something is deserving of attention, it does not mean that I direct my present energy and focus to figuring out what I should look at and focus on it

Attention is more of a preparation. It's being ready to attend to something that may come across my reality today.

When someone comes to my front door, and I send them away because I am busy with things that are imagined. I fail to attend to the reality in front of me

Attend to the demands of reality, and not a fantasy you imagine

That's interesting because I think we are all called to live this way and to be present to the reality around us.

That reminds me of how [202205180947 - Social Media Hijacks Attention](Notes/202205180947%20-%20Social%20Media%20Hijacks%20Attention.md)

It's similar because we live in a world where our attention has been completely hijacked

It's different because social media is new, but our ability to be hijacked is not

It's important because this is necessary for a meaningful life
