The statement that "nitrogen doesn't cost anything" might raise eyebrows, especially for those of us who understand that even air isn't "free" in a polluted city. What the author likely means is that when a resource is abundant and easily accessible, its cost tends to be negligible. However, this overlooks the costs associated with extraction, refinement, and distribution.

The crux of the matter is the transformative power of technology to shift the economics of scarcity. Think about it: centuries ago, salt was a precious commodity. Now, it's so cheap and abundant that we scatter it on icy roads. The same could be said for information in the digital age. Once confined to libraries and scholars, it's now virtually free and at our fingertips.

In the realm of health and fitness, this principle is a game-changer. Advanced technologies could make personalized medicine or tailored fitness programs more accessible, reducing the "cost" of optimal health. Imagine a future where AI-driven health coaching is as ubiquitous and affordable as a Google search.

But there's a flip side. As technology makes resources abundant, it also has the potential to make some skills and jobs obsolete. It's a double-edged sword that requires thoughtful navigation.

So, while the concept of "infinite intelligence" solving most problems is enticing, it's not a magic wand. It's a tool that, when wielded wisely, can create abundance out of scarcity, but also demands a new kind of literacy to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape
