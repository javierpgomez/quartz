### Key Ideas

Adam Zagajewski's Poem Transformation comes from his book "Mystery for Beginners"
and I'm just so obsessed with the title of that book "Mystery for Beginners"

That's interesting because I love mysticism, and I've been thinking of different ways that I can unwind and understand it. Maybe write more about it and share it with people

Right now that reminds me of my love for Simone Weil's work, which I'm currently writing about. [[Attention For Simone Weil]]

It's similar because Simone Weil is also from Europe, and she was also an exile in a way, just like Adam Zagajewski.

It's different because they come from different times, though history repeats itself

It's important because it always helps to go through these poems. Poems can change our lives
