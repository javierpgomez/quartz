(in increasing order of effectiveness)

9. Constants, parameters, numbers (subsidies, taxes, standards).  
8. Regulating negative feedback loops.  
7. Driving positive feedback loops.  
6. Material flows and nodes of material intersection.  
5. Information flows.  
4. The rules of the system (incentives, punishments, constraints).  
3. The distribution of power over the rules of the system.  
2. The goals of the system.  
1. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, power structure, rules, its culture — arises.

And I'd like to make my own version of this for personal fitness and health.
