### Key Idea

Let’s start here: What is DNS? It’s a rehabilitation approach developed by the [Prague School of Manual Medicine & Rehabilitation](https://www.rehabps.com/REHABILITATION/Home.html) to stimulate movement control centers in the brain, helping our bodies move the way they were meant to.

When we are born, our brains are pre-programmed to help our bodies learn movement, coordinating our muscles and joints. While we start out pretty defenseless, our bodies gain postural stability, core stabilization, and movement in our first few months and years.
