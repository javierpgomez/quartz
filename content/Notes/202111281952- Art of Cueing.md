### The Language of Coaching

This week, I’m discovering the work of [Nick Winkelman](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/f3NlCub_X/c?w=Iqnif6rNQ3yIVIc-xAJHqMAqjs-Ouyq1OPjdgRGi9r0.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9OaWNrV2lua2VsbWFuIiwiciI6IjkyOWY2NzU3LWQyNjEtNDg4OS0wNWQ4LWRiYTIzZDJjODU3NCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9). He’s a coach who is obsessed with the words we use when teaching movement.

His main idea is that the words that we use matter. It has a measurable effect on our performance. This is most useful for coaches. But even if you’re a regular person trying to move better, there are a few takeaways to help you here.

Here are some quick principles from my first jump in.

### 1. Use an external cue

Instead of saying “lift your arms more” (internal cue), try saying instead “push towards the ceiling.” (external cue) The reason this works is that with an internal cue you zone in on one body part, and the body as a whole coordinates less. But with an external cue, your whole body focuses on that goal, and the body coordinates better.

### 2. Use metaphors and images

Apart from external cues, using images and metaphors also helps the body coordinate. Try using different images when you're doing movements.

-   “Take of like a plane” when you’re sprinting
-   “Bounce like a gazelle” when jumping
-   “Sit back into a chair” when doing a squat

### 3. Get into Trial and Error

Because we’re using metaphors and images, there’s a bit of trial and error involved. We have different images in our head. Some metaphors might work better for you than others. It becomes more of an art than a science at this point. Trying different things and experimenting is the name of the game.
