This is the sweet spot for learning.
It has to be at the right difficulty.
Learn at your level, 
or a little bit more difficult

Otherwise, you're not really developing
or growing

How do you know what that level is?

You should be challenged
but not frustrated

Bored is not where you want to be

I admit, I'm addicted to quick wins. It feels good. 

But in the podcast I linked, they talk about how trying to perform well in the now makes me learn less down the line.

It's a choose-one situation:

(1) make it easy and perform well now, or

(2) practice at a desirable difficulty, fail, make mistakes, and learn more over time.

- It's like going to the gym, and lifting light weights, looking good, but not getting stronger. - It's like playing at level 1, and just doing what's too easy.

Instead of playing at my level, I'll beat less skilled players. Feel good but not improve

- Imagine Lebron James playing basketball with high school kids. He'll win every time. But it does nothing for his own ability

If you're not failing in some way- you may be performing well on paper, but you're not learning as much as you could. [Failure is part of the process](https://shoutout.wix.com/so/15NhoKjLc/c?w=DWemoJfoSMnqzWQE2492OL7UhzpOa8fcfEX3A6SCpZI.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZml0Zm9ybGlmZS5waC9wb3N0L2ZhaWx1cmUtaXMtYW4tb3B0aW9uLWhvdy10by1kZXNpZ24teW91ci1oZWFsdGgiLCJyIjoiNTMyMjEwZmQtZWRiNy00ZDZkLTIzY2UtYWFlNGFhNTNmMjg0IiwibSI6ImxwIn0).

Consider finding ways to bring in desirable difficulty to whatever you're practicing.
