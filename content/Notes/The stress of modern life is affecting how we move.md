### Key Idea

You're up all night scrolling through your phone, you wake up groggy and exhausted, and you're stuck in a chair all day long. It's no wonder that our movement patterns suffer when we're under so much stress.

Sleep is crucial for our overall health and well-being, and when we don't get enough of it, our bodies can't function properly. The same goes for staring at screens. Too much screen time can lead to headaches, neck pain, and even eye strain.

And then there's sitting. It might not seem like a big deal, but sitting for long periods of time can actually be quite harmful to our health. It can cause back pain, neck pain, and even lead to obesity.
