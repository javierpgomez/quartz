## Key Idea
- What really unlocked cooking for me was reading this book.
- There have been tons and tons of cookbooks in the past.

- They create this feeling of having succeeded or failed.

- In Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat
- Samin Nosrat gives you the principles.
- And then let's you go ahead and experiment
