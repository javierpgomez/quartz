Even though I want to live on a self-sufficient homestead, [this article](https://worksinprogress.substack.com/p/notes-on-progress-an-environmentalist) is one that I constantly think about and gives me pause.

Because it completely goes counter that what I intuitively think an eco-friendly life looks like.

From the article:
>"I know that my way of eating is low-carbon. I’ve spent years poring over the data. Microwaves are the most efficient way to cook. Local food is [often no better](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local) than food shipped from continents away. Organic food [often has a higher](https://ourworldindata.org/is-organic-agriculture-better-for-the-environment) carbon footprint. And packaging [is a tiny fraction](https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions-food) of a food’s environmental footprint, and often lengthens its shelf-life."

So if I'm going to make claims to living in a way that balances my own needs, the needs of my family, society, and environment. It's going to have to be even more nuanced
