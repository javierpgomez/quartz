# Fighting Homeostasis (concept)

Things are always trying to go back to homeostasis.
That's a place where things are balanced and equal


#### "When you fight homeostasis- in yourself or in others- look out for the underlying mechanisms that are working against your efforts to make changes"
Quote from
- [[Notes/Super Thinking (book outline)]]

So when you try to make changes, it won't be easy. Because there are things around you that are trying to bring things back to a certain way

It could be things within your body. For example. There's this idea of set points in weight. Your weight always tries to go back to a certain number.

It could be within your social circle. For example. Your friends don't like the new you. They try to make you go back to the way you were instead of supporting and encouraging your new habits.
