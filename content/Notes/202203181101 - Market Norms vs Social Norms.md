# My writing (250-300 words)

This is using money as a motivator vs
Using relationships as a motivator

It's like covenants and contracts I suppose

Alexa had that story about Tanay.
and how people jsut did what they said they would do
They just showed up and fulfilled their obligations

No contracts.
Just social norms.
(No need more money)
