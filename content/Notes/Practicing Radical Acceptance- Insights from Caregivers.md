Radical acceptance is something we practice over and over to help us loosen our grip on unwanted situations, on letting them control our well-being and taking up this mental real state that's so precious, our attention. 

So there are statements that we can say that help us. So I'm an expert at this because I have, I'm a caregiver, and I often need to refocus from wishing things were different, **trying to solve things to really radical acceptance of this is how things are right now.** 

**This is the reality.** 

And by just reminding ourselves that there is freedom within that, that there are things that you can do, you can actually live better, live well with these situations. 

So let me tell you what we found from our caregivers. We measure where their mind is at night. 

**We ping them when we say in the last five minutes, how much have you been wishing things were different? How much have you been engaged and focused and what you're doing, right, right before we pinged you?**

**So stop wishing things are different. As tempting as that might be**
