# Concepts over Technique Idea

## Sources:
- GMB Modifying movement workshop

## Key ideas
### First idea: When teaching people movement, people tend to focus too much on having the right "technique"
- This reminds of me college education with the skills tracks vs the learning to learn idea
- In the case of movement, Ryan identifies four key concepts
	1. Base
	2. Proximity
	3. Speed
	4. Momentum

### An example
- A great way of understanding concept over technique has to do with the phrase
**"tighter is lighter"**
- If you understand this concept, then you get the idea of proximity
- If a weight is over a center of gravity, then it's easier to support, you don't have to exert as much effort.
- But the further out you go, the more it becomes a challenge to keep that weight upright
- Because the further away something is from your center of gravity, the heavier something becomes.
- In that case, if I have to lift something heavy, I can bring it closer to my center of gravity and then use it that way.

## Become Adaptible
- The ability to adapt and be creative
- You're not bound by technique or form.
	- And you don't have to argue which is the "best" or right way to do things.

- You just have to understand the principle, then you'll be able to apply it in a very different kind of way.

## You can only Personalize
- You can also personalize your movements then.
- You're not bound to one specific form or one specific way

- You have the ability to play
- **See also: [[Notes/Play as a consequence free environment]]**
- You can actually move around and experiment with different types of things
- This is a massive opportunity for growth and development.

## If you just stick to technique
- Then At some point you'll get stuck.
- For example, you'll say
- Oh I can never make my movement look exactly the same as the technique that I saw on Youtube.
- I guess I should just give up and try something else na lang.
- So then you won't be able to stick to it.
- Or you're always looking for the right technique. 
- But you'll never really get around to learning the principles.

- It's like a way that we move from externalizing your outcomes.
- Relying on crutches or outside tools vs. Learning to rely on internal ideas and cues
- Learning how to trust your own coach and your own ideas.
- And get good thoughts on how your body actually moves.
