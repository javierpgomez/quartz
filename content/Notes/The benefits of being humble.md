### Key Idea

By being humble, we are better able to celebrate the successes of others without feeling jealous or resentful of their progress.

For example, Dr Neal Krause and his team demonstrated that humility can help buffer the impact of a stressful event, helping to protect overall happiness and satisfaction with life, while also protecting from depression and anxiety.

Practising humility can therefore help to boost wellbeing.
