# Low context and high context culture

Just to account for some cultural differences

In a low context context, 
everything must be said
very explicitly

In a high context culture
you have to read all the cues around things

I remember when I was teaching those kids at 
Casa Bayanihan

I had to help them understand 
that the philippines is a high context culture
