The poem "Leaving the Island" captures the nuanced emotional process we undergo when exiting a chapter in our lives. As we prepare to leave, we often engage in a form of "narrative forgiveness"â€”a revisiting and retelling of our past experiences, tinted in more favorable hues. This isn't a distortion of reality but rather a coping mechanism, a form of emotional alchemy that transforms past pains or disappointments into valuable lessons or even romantic memories. This 'sweet sadness,' tinged with forgiveness, acts as a propulsion system, giving us the emotional lift-off necessary for embarking on a new journey. It makes us more resilient and adaptable, easing the transition and preparing us for whatever comes next. So, while the lenses may be rose-colored, they serve a purpose. They allow us to create a story that fuels our forward momentum, while also making peace with what we're leaving behind.
