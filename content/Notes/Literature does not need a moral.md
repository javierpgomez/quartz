### Key Idea

By focusing so much on morals and trying to make it so that everything has a lesson- you end up with this kind of thing where a lot of works don't fit

It distorts and devalues the literary arts to conflate an education in the history and interpretation of literature with an education in morality ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515116126/20067227))

**Note:** People do this with the bible also
