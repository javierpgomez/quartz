Because I am a great coach who can transform people's health
and I am building a life of freedom, so I will work for that.

### How much is my time worth

**Scenario 1:
I work for half the year; 
and I make 6 million pesos a year
and I work 30 hours a week (6 hours a day)**

My annual income in 3 years:
$100,000

Number of hours to work in 1 year:
30 hours a week for 26 weeks *(half the year)*
780 hours

So my hourly worth is 
$128 per hour *(PHP6000 per hour)*

**Scenario 2:
I have 6 weeks vacation
and I make 3 million pesos a year
and I work 30 hours a week (6 hours a day)**

$50,000 income
with 30 hours a week
times 46 weeks in a year (6 weeks vacation)
is 1380 hours a year
$36 per hour *(P1500 per hour)*

**Scenario 3:
I work half a year
and I make 3 million pesos a year
and I work 30 hours a week (6 hours a day)**

$50000 income
with 30 hours a week
in 26 weeks = 780 hours a year
$64 per hour *(P3000 per hour)*
