# My writing (250-300 words)

We think imagination is something that's completely frivolous

It's a complete waste of time, and something that's only for people who don't have real things to worry about. It's for the artists, writers and dreamers.

But what if it turns out that imagination is THE single most useful thing for society

A quick cliche example- Steve Jobs took the time to imagine a beautiful cellphone

And he completely changed the world because of that. In a sense, imagination became the most powerful and practical thing in society. It is the only thing that actually brings about real change.

Everything else is implementation.

So the ability to imagine is what actually makes a difference. And thus you can think of imagination as a social good. Like sunlight, land, water and all other things that we share in common. When someone has a powerful imagination, we all benefit from that
