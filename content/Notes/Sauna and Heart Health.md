The sauna elevates heart rate and blood pressure (linearly and then exponentially with an increase in temperature and exposure time), increases blood flow to the skin, and causes sweat rate to go up. Exercise also does all of these things, [and some studies have found that the cardiovascular responses to sauna are similar to low-intensity steady-state aerobic exercise.](https://substack.com/redirect/16e0bb1b-92cb-4983-bc1d-31134aa1587f?j=eyJ1IjoiMW93emhrIn0.b9diEpiiQOZ3PpqOKlZCOCWqnjbqGByU2IvzdyDK-eQ) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr81r9666pkye6d9qmbhfrs1))
