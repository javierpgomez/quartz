# A second brain for your workouts

## Source:
- I'm blending on several ideas that I keep seeing online
- The [[Idea Factory]] by [[Ali Abdal]] or [[Dickie Bush]]
- [[Notes/Tiago Forte]] and [[David Perell]]
- This is also inspired by [[Notes/Zettelkasten]]

## Key Ideas
- I want to come up with a system, to instantly capture your fitness ideas and insights as quickly as you can
- And then you come back to it in a spaced repetition kind of way.
