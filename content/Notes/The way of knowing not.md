In the "Ascent of Mt Carmel," John of the Cross writes:

"To come to the knowledge of all
desire the knowledge of nothing

*and *

To come to the knowledge you have not
you must go by a way in which you know not"

To me- as someone who likes to study about faith and God, it's a reminder that knowledge can only go so far.

Saint Augustine wrote, *"If you comprehend it, it isn't God."*

This doesn't mean that there's no point in studying about your faith. But don't fall into the trap that studying is all there is to it. At some point, you're going to have to set aside the books- and experience the God you are reading about. Like John of Cross, alone in his cell- everything he thought he knew about God was challenged, and transformed.

Knowledge of God is different from knowing God
