# You have choices when working out

Working out is like ordering at a restaurant 
You have choices
You can identify what your menu is.

## Giving People Choices

Give people a list of habits to choose from
Based on how they performed in the past
It can be AI based
But for now it's just a human

## Other benefits

Gives you agency
Makes you feel like you're in control
You are empowered
It's not like you "have no choice"
