# My writing (250-300 words)

Attention is not about focusing on finding answers for Weil

It is more about seeing problems, and learning to sit with them even if we cannot find the answers.

In a subject like Mathematics, we can sit for a long time with a geometry problem, and at the end of an hour have made little progress.

But in that hour, we will have entered into "another more mysterious dimension" (Weil's words). 

This is a moral dimension: It is a space where, by our act of attention, we grasp what has always been the real mystery- the lives of our fellow human beings.
