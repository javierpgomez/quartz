# My writing (250-300 words)

The pace of technology is just so fast today

Everyone has a fitness tracker of some sort. And even if you don't wear it on your wrist, your smartphone probably passively tracks things like sleep and steps. And while access to health tracking is getting more available, it doesn't automatically lead to better health

Because so what if you have all this data? Do you know what to do with it?

In fact, this may lead to information overload

I have so much health data that I have no idea what to do. I feel overwhelmed and paralyzed by all the information I have to process

Then it becomes important to continue to ask the basic questions- the stuff that can't be tracked by data.

Questions like:
- What am I trying to be healthy for?
- Who do I want to be healthy for?
- What do I imagine myself doing 10 years from now?

Those can help guide you through your data
