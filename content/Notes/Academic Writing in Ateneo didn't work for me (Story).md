# Academic Writing in Ateneo didn't work for me (Story)

## Source
- Me! It's a personal anecdote

## Key Ideas

- The feedback loop in academic writing was so big
	- It felt like I had no idea what I was doing
	- I didn't know if I was going in the right direction
- So it wasn't helpful for me
	- And it wasn't motivating
	- I didn't really want to do it
- Because I couldn't tell if I was doing the right thing or the wrong thing.
