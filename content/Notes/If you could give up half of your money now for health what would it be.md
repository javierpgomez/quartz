# My writing (250-300 words)

If you could give up half of your net worth for health, what would you get with your health?

What would your life look like and what would you be able to do?

It's an exercise to help us get to the core of what our motivations are.

And figure out what kind of life we really want to live

We want money
So that we can be healthy
But we want health
So that??

The freedom?
The opportunity to do what we want to do.
