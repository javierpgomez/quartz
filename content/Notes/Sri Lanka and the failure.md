### Key Idea

Sri Lanka was forcing a transition to organic
but it wasn't thought through, so it was disasterous
so this article shows the trouble of going too organic before it's time and it's ready

“But the underlying reason for the fall of Sri Lanka is that its leaders fell under the spell of Western green elites peddling organic agriculture and ‘ESG,’ which refers to investments made following supposedly higher Environmental, Social, and Governance criteria. Sri Lanka has a near-perfect ESG score (98) which is higher than Sweden (96) or the United States (51).”
