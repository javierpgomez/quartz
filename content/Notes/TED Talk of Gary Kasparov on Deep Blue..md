# Kasparov's Quote

"We must face our fears if we want to get the most out of technology â€” and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of humanity"
Garry Kasparov

"A weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a powerful machine alone, but more remarkably is super to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process."
