- Rules are very low level thinking.
	- Itâ€™s like how laws are very low leverl thinking.
	- But it is necessary for a certain group of people

### Guidelines (like the pirates code?)

- Guidelines are a bit above the rules.
	- Though still imperfect.
	- They are more like systems.
	- They let you operate within a certain space

### Skills are the highest level.
- If you have the skills, 
- you can ditch guidelines
- you can ditch rules.
- You might understand them.
- And get why they work.
- But you are free!
