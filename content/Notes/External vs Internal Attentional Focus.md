# Internal Focus and External Focus

## Context

This is about learning and how to develop new skills

## What is it

Internal focus
- You focus on your own body. You think about where my feet should be poistioned
- or where my hand should be

External focus
-   the intended effect
-   You focus on some external goal

A quote from William James
> Keep your eye at the place aimed at, and your hand will fetch; think of your hand, you will likely miss your aim."

The finding here is that external focus works well for skill acquisition and performance.
