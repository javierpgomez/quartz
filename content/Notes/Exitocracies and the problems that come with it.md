What Do I Think About Network States?

### Key Idea

I don't quite understand what an exitocracy is. It seems like democratic states will let you move and visit freely

The risk is that exitocracy becomes recognized as the primary way you do the "freedom" thing, and societies that value freedom will become exitocratic, but centralized states will censor and suppress these impulses, adopt a militaristic attitude of national unconditional loyalty, and run roughshod over everyone else ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522307276/20088793))

There's this issue for me that they're already based in physical locations. and have to abide by those states' laws
