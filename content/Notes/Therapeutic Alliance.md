# My writing (250-300 words)

Having a coach you believe in
Having a coach you trust

It's not just about business

Is the concept then here.
That I'm finding the perfect price point
Where it can still remain a social norm?

No it's more like I'm balancing market norms and social norms.

If it's priced reasonably.
Then it can be like that.
