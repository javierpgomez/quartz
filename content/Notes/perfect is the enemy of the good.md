# Perfect is the enemy of the good

If you are constantly obsessing over the perfect answer
You might not ever do anything.
Good enough is just that. Good enough

This idea works now in the context of healthy habits.
Do I need to find the best and most perfect behavior?
Or can I just find one thatâ€™s good enough for me?
