### Key Idea

By disposing of the burden of physics-esque rigor, philosophy manages to be more compelling. Seneca isn’t pretending this is some universal law like gravitation which will certainly reproduce under further experimentation. He’s just tellin’ it like it is.

**Note:** Why philosophy is better than science. You can accept or reject it, and it makes no pretension to objectivity
