### Key Ideas

**What’s happening:** Strava’s annual [Year in Sport report](https://www.strava.com/yis-community-2022) highlighted trends across the platform. In particular, the effect of group training significantly boosted overall training.

-   Compared to riding solo, cycling in pairs resulted in ~80% more time per ride and ~60% more distance.
-   Riding in groups of three or more added 125% more time in the saddle, going 160% longer per ride.
-   Walking or hiking with a partner increased both time and distance nearly 50% vs. solo trips.
