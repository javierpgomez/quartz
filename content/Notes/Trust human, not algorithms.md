# My writing (250-300 words)

In the age of the algorithm, it still makes sense to trust humans

I like to think about movies. And how it's super hard for Netflix to figure out what I'll actually enjoy watching. I don't think it's becuase I'm different. I think it's because movie tastes are just weird

And when I see the recommendations. It always ends up being 'safe' (though there's nothing wrong with that)

Though I'm a bit less interested in 'can't go wrong.' Sometimes I want to be blown out of the water with something really weird. And when that happens, I look to humans
