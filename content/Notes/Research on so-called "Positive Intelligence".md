The TL;Dr on this journal article is that it mathematically models the dynamics of whta makes teams successful.

**And in short, the magic number is 75%**

What does this mean? It means you need 3 out of every 4 interactions to be a positive interaction in order to create a thriving [Feedback Loop](Notes/Feedback%20Loop.md)

This was counter intuitive, because we tend to think it must be even. 1 good interaction outweights 1 bad interaction.

But because we're human, and we tend to have a [Negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias)1 to 1 is not enough. It takes 3 positive interactions to balance out a negative one!
