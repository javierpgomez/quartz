The **biophilia hypothesis** (also called BET) suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature") and other forms of life. [Edward O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson "E. O. Wilson") introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, _Biophilia_ (1984). [^1]

He defines biophilia as "the urge to affiliate with other forms of life". [^2]


That's interesting because we had to wait for research to tell us what to think about nature

That reminds me [The rights of nature](Notes/The%20rights%20of%20nature.md)

It's similar because if nature takes care of us in this way, then doesn't it mean we should take care of nature also?

It's different because it's more legal

It's important because being able to take care of nature legally, scientifically, and to demonstrate some of these 'intangible' things can be helpful for the development of nature
