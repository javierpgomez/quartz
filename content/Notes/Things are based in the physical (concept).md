# Things are based in the physical (concept)

## Analogy

I love maps and geography
In maps, you can look at the physical features of a region.
And figure out why some of the history is the way it is.

## Story
In China, etc etc
and it would have all been avoided, if their cities were 5 km west
or something like that.
(again I'm just inventing this right now)

## Abstract is rooted in the real
We like to think things like psychology are completely in our heads
but they are rooted in very real things
like sleep
eat 
breath
