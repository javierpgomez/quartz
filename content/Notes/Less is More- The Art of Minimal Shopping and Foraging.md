The modern shopping experience is often a matter of excessâ€”buy-one-get-one-free offers, unplanned meals leading to waste, and shopping carts filled with more than we need. This creates a cycle of consumption and waste that not only strains our wallets but also the environment.

Two ideas captivate me: shopping less and foraging more. It's a nod to a simpler, more connected way of living. It shifts the focus from mindless consumption to mindful gathering. Shopping "little and often" becomes not just a method but a philosophy. It minimizes waste and maximizes the utility of each purchase, aligning with the principle of living green.

The art of foraging, often overlooked, connects us back to the land and makes us participants in our own survival. There's a sense of accomplishment in finding wild garlic, berries, or even nettles, which are "so underrated," according to experts.

These two practices combined could make for an exciting experiment in sustainable living. They encourage a deeper connection with our environment, and perhaps even with ourselves, as we become more deliberate in our choices.
