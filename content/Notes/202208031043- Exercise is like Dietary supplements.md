# My writing (250-300 words)

It's no secret that our culture has become increasingly sedentary. We sit at desks for hours on end, we drive instead of walk, and we generally don't move around as much as we used to. This lack of movement has had a significant impact on our health, and it's something that we need to address.

Exercise is an innovation for a sedentary culture. It's a new thing.

It's like dietary supplements; it's only necessary because the culture has made it necessary. And just like supplements, exercise can have a significant impact on our health.

Think about a dietary supplement, you would take this if there's some kind of deficiency in your diet. But if you can get it through regular food and eating, then the supplement is not as necessary.

Same thing for exercise.

There are a number of ways to get moving more, and it's important to find something that works for you. Walking, running, weightlifting, yoga, and dancing are all great options. And there's no need to go to the gym; you can get moving at home, at work, or even while you're out and about.

The goal is to get you moving more, not necessarily exercising more.
