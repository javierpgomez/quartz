The third law only dawned on me when I was studying the public’s beliefs about economics, and noticed that income _growth_ seems to increase economic literacy, even though income _level_ does not. 

In other words, poor people whose income is rising—like recent immigrants—have more than the average amount of economic sense; rich people whose income is falling—like the Kennedy family—have less. 

If I am right about the idea trap, then advocates of free-market reforms should always root for good times and marginal improvements.
