## Misconceptions of fitness

When you hear the word “fitness,” or the phrase “survival of the fittest,” you probably imagine some super athlete running a marathon. Or a strong animal surviving out in the wild.

We’ve come to completely associate fitness with doing amazing things and being awesome and strong.

But what if I told you that this stupid fish is fit.

Fitness does not mean strong per se.

# Readjusting your definition

If being fit doesn’t mean being strong, then what does it mean?

Being fit means that something is suited. When you put on a shirt that fits, this means that it’s not to big and it’s not too small. It’s just right for what you need. It’s the right thing for the right job. 

Being fit means that something is adapted. It belongs in its environment. It isn’t out of place. It’s not useless and it’s not extra.

I think of marathon running as a great example for this. There is no instance in your life, when running a marathon will ever be practical. Yes, it can give you a good sense of accomplishment. Yes it can be a great achievement. But I’m 99% percent sure, you’ll never have to run 42km in a day.

 We don’t have to hunt for our food anymore. We don’t have to run away from lions.

# Understanding the demands of your life

Ask yourself then: What do I need to be fit for?

It’s a big over arching question, that can be vague and hard to answer. I can break it down into a few more questions.
- What are the physical demands of your work?
	- Are you lifting heavy things?
	- Are you on your feet?
	- Are you hunched over all the time? (That’s physical)
- What about the physical demands of your hobbies?
	- Do you play basketball on weekends?
	- Do you like to go hiking or diving?
	- Do you like to go on walks?
- Who benefits from you being fit?
	- I can play with my pets 
	- I can play with my kids
	- I can help me wife do work around the house
- What kind of activity would you like to do in 20 years? in 30 years?
	- I’d like to still be walking every day
	- I’d like to be climbing mountains when I’m old
	- I’d like to be lifting weights as an old man

Your answers to these questions might give you some idea of what you’re trying to be fit for. And thus, what fitness looks like to you.

# Making yourself fit to that

If you understand the goal, and you understand the constraints that you have. Then you can start to make some decision that will help your fitness.

Say from the questions above, I say. My work is sitting at my computer writing all day. But as a hobby I like to do gardening. I mainly want to benefit my wife by being handy around the house, and as I age, I’d like to still be active, walking, maybe running, playing with kids and grandkids.

All these give me the constraits to fit my program towards.
- I would try to work on the strain from writing
- I would try to be strong enough to lift soil bags
- I would try to be mobile enough to bend down while working in the garden
- I want to have enough cardio health to be able to walk and run

But if from the questions above, I say: My work is in a restaurant, and I’m always on my feet. I love trianing for marathons, and I want to help other people run too. As I age, I’d still like to be running long distances.

Then for me, what it means to be fit is:
- I work on my knees and other running muslces
- I think about the long term health of my running

No one fitness program is good for everyone. 
In none of the above examples does being fit entail lifting 100s of pouds in bench presses. (That may be fit for some people, but not for everyone). So you can be living a very simple, modest exercise life, and still be very fit!

Fitness is just that. How suited is your workout to your lifestlye.

# Redefining fitness for yourself

This kind of fitness changes over time too.
As you grow,
And your life changes.
What it means to be fit changes with it also.
This is just the natural progressionof things.
