# My writing (250-300 words)

It's because the health goal is vague

Run a marathon has a fucking clear goal
But build lifelong health?
What does that even look like?

What's your day to day training if you aren't competing or running a marathon? tricky tricky if you ask me

So instead the trick is the break it up into a systems thing.

What's the experiment that you're currently running.
What did you learn from it?
How did it work for you?

Goal network is part of this process too I feell

Suboridnating the goals- seeing how they all connect together
