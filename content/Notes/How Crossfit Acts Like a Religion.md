The rise of CrossFit as a non-religious community functioning in ways that resemble religion is a fascinating phenomenon that reflects broader societal trends. 

With the decline of traditional religious institutions and the increasing number of people identifying as religiously unaffiliated, many people are seeking out alternative communities to fill the void left by the decline of organized religion. 

CrossFit provides a sense of community, shared values, and rituals that are reminiscent of religious practices. These activities create a sense of belonging and shared purpose, much like what one might find in a religious community.

However, there are also concerns about the ways in which these non-religious communities can function in ways that are exclusive or harmful. 

CrossFit, for example, has been criticized for promoting an unhealthy and dangerous culture of extreme exercise and body shaming. 

Additionally, the sense of community and shared purpose that these communities provide can also lead to insularity and the exclusion of outsiders. 

As society continues to change and evolve, it is important to consider the ways in which non-religious communities can function in positive and negative ways, and to work towards creating inclusive and welcoming spaces for all individuals.

That's interesting because if we care about getting people healthy, thinking about it from a structural and societal level is where we can make really big impacts.

Will power is way overrated, and designing your environment is 10x more effective.

That reminds me of [Find a group where your desired culture exists](Find%20a%20group%20where%20your%20desired%20culture%20exists.md).

It's similar because if you want to make some kind of positive (or negative) change in yourself, then surround yourself with a group where that behavior is already manifested. That's the idea behind things like AA or the 12 step programs.

You acquire the beliefs, behaviors, and cultural norms through osmosis

But there's always a danger of cult-like or fanatic attitudes. The question is how to harness it properly and fully and effective.

It's important because if we want people to be healthy, we definitely need to resolve this question.
