# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

Don’t build a system that demands extreme technological savvy to succeed, because what if you don’t have the aptitude or resources to learn those skills?

Make web3 not just for the tech savvy also

This one because it's all nerds but not enough humanists in web3 right now
