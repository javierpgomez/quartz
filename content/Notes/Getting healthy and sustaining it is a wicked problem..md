## Health and Wicked Problems

Getting healthy and sustaining it is a [[Notes/wicked problem]]

Just like sobriety in my opinion

A wicked problem is something that is multifaceted
It cannot really be tackled with just one thing
You have to approach it from a holistic
and well rounded approach

Use many things to solve and tackle your issues and concerns
And finding whatever works.
(This is a bit of that William James pragmatist approach)
