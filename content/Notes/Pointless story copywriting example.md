A few days ago, after finishing my workout, I went to a small diner and ate three steak sandwiches.  After that, I was overcome with the desire to hurt somebody.  I mean bloody their nose, blacken their eyes and kick them in the balls.

You ever have that happen to you?  You ever became enraged for no reason whatsoever?  I decided it would be a good idea to pound on the young musclehead a few feet away from me in the diner.  Then, it hit me.  I suddenly realized that if I went after him, the bastard would probably fight back!

I hate that part.  When they fight back.  I’d truly kick a lot of ass if I could find a steady supply of people who wouldn’t fight back.

Oh well.  My mood instantly evaporated.  I gave the musclehead a friendly greeting, tipped the waitress and left the restaurant with no broken bones or bruises.

What was that all about?  I really don’t know.  I haven’t a clue why that sudden rage overcame me.  Plus, I don ‘t have a clue why I’m writing about it.

So, I’ll stop.  I’ll go off on another tangent.
