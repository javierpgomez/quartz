# Pahiyas festival

(Our Seasons are different)

It's all on May 15 though

Along with the similar 
Agawan Festival  and 
Araña’t Baluarte Festival in Sariaya and 
Gumaca respectively, 
these harvest festivals honour San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers.

That means our harvest festivals are in May 15
That's the general end of the growing season
