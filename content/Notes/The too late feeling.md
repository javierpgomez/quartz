Do you have this feeling that "it's too late for me to work on my health?"

Everyone feels this way at some point. 
- If only I had started a bit earlier
- I'm so far behind from everyone else
- I can't catch up

Trust me, everyone's been there. I've been there

Because I've injured myself so much in the past, I feel like I'm already at a disadvantage.

The rest of my life feels like damage control and playing catch up with everyone else who has a better grasp of their health. And because I've injured myself in the past, I'm stuck mitigating problems instead of making progress.

But the truth is that there's so much I can do for my health.

I don't want to look back and think about how great my health used to be. I want to look forward and think about what's yet to come for my health. The key thing to remember is that it won't look **the way it was before.** 

Instead, it will be something new and different- and that's exciting
