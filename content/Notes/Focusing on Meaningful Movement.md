When you're stuck in an injury mindset, it's easy to get caught up in the negative. (As we talked about last time)

But one thing that injury does give is the chance to ask a very important question to yourself:

And that question is "Why would I care to get back into action?" 

It sounds like an obvious question- but diving into it may reveal something to you. It can help you understand your mindset when it comes to injury, recovery, and what you value.

"Why does movement matter to you?"

Maybe you love the way it makes you feel. The way it boosts your energy levels, or the way it helped you stay fit and healthy. 

Maybe you love the goal setting. You love performing well and hitting your targets. You love reaching new heights.

Maybe it matters for you to stay healthy for your family. Or the people in your life who rely on you.

If you have kids, maybe they need you to be healthy and active so you can chase them around and play with them. 

If you have a partner, they may appreciate having an active partner to share activities with. 

And if you have friends who love to exercise, they're probably missing your company on their runs or hikes.

Remembering that there are people in your life who want you to be active can be a strong incentive to get moving again.

In 2008, when tore my ACL, I was at the peak of my game. I was one of the best college track and field athletes in the country.

My injury was bad luck, but I had tasted being one of the best. I wanted to do everything I could do to get back to the top.

So I saw the doctors, I did the exercises, I trained hard to get back into things.

Then in 2010 I tore my other ACL.

This time it was different. I was nearing the end of my college career. I was thinking about doing other things apart from sports. I didn't care anymore about staying at the top of my performance.

So I went through the process of recovery, like last time.

But to be honest with you, moving and exercising was never the same again.

My whole life, I found meaning to exercise through competition. I wanted to beat my competitors, and I wanted to be the best.

When that went away after my 2nd big injury, I couldn't find anything that made me want to move and exercise anymore.

I lived with that struggle for 10 years.

I had no idea what kind of exercise I wanted to do. Especially since I didn't want to get injured again. There was too much frustration.

No matter how careful you are, or how much you prepare, there's always the chance you'll get injured. 

It's the reality of life. 

I don't know anyone who has gone through their entire life without any kind of injury at all.

It's impossible.

In the journey to finding movement again- and movement that is meaningful, there are a few ways of thinking that I find valuable.

1.  What movement makes it worth it?
2.  What movement feels like play?   
3.  What movements do I want to explore?

What movements make it worth it?

When it comes to figuring out what you want to do, it can be a tough journey. And people who have a sport they're passionate about are very lucky

Recently, I have started asking the question, "If I will continue to have some form of pain, what are the movements that I really care about, and would be worth working through my injury problems for”

If I have anxieties about injury and pain- so what activities can I do that would make it worthwhile for me? 

I have to choose something I love, so that if I get hurt and injured, I'll find a way to keep growing and exploring.

These are very personal, and different for each of us.

For me, there is nothing I love more than when I'm hiking in the forest. And I would love to keep healthy and fit to be able to hike throughout my life.

I have worked with someone who loves scuba diving, and her purpose in staying active and healthy is for that. Even when she has an injury or a setback, she's eager to recover for her love of scuba diving.

For some, meaningful movement is biking and playing at the park with their kids. For some meaningful movement is finishing a marathon. There are so many possibilities for meaningful movement.

What feels like play?

It's no secret that I'm a big fan of play. 

Kids play all the time. They make up games and move around. But we forget how to play when we become adults. 

This doesn't mean you go back to your childhood games.

It's more about asking:

- What are movements that let me explore?
- What are movements that let me be creative?
- What are movements that I find fun?

Instead of thinking of play as a waste of time, think of play as something that is essential to our well being. It makes us more open and more creative.

After all, even as adults, we still want to stay connected to our sense of wonder and our capacity for joy.

Find the fun

However, there is one factor that I believe is more important than any other when it comes to choosing an exercise routine: the "fun factor."

Your chances of sticking to an exercise program are much higher if you choose something that you actually enjoy.

If you hate running, there's no point in forcing yourself to go for a run every day. 

But if you enjoy hiking, then make that a part of your routine. 

Or if you like playing in the playground, see if you can find a way to incorporate that into your workout.

The bottom line is that you should try to find an activity that feels like play rather than work. When you enjoy yourself, it's much easier to stick with it.

So next time you're wondering what exercise you should do, ask yourself this question: "What feels like play to me?" And then go do that.

A chance to explore

Finally, getting injured, and being stuck in an injury mindset led down the path of exploring what it is that I love to do. It took me 10 years to break out of that mindset! (I don't want it to take so long for you)  

Sometimes, an injury can give you a chance to ask new questions and explore new things.

The best thing you can do is to be mentally flexible and adapt. If things don't happen as you plan, try taking a different path.

It's not always easy, but it's important to lead you to discover the movement that is meaningful for you.

//

In the end you have to find your WHY

What is that thing that motivates you to keep on going forward

Maybe it's the sense of camaraderie you feel with your teammates. 
Or the feeling of accomplishment you get when you finally complete that difficult workout. 
Or maybe the vision of your kids and grandkids playing with you on the floor

Whatever it is, finding that deeper meaning will help you stay motivated and focused on your recovery.

The road to recovery can be long and difficult. But it's important to remember that you're not alone. There are many others who have been in your shoes and come out the other side. Reach out to them for support and advice. When you're ready to start moving again, they'll be there to help you every step of the way.
