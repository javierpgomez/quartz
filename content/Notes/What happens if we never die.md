### Key Idea

It’s not just about increasing the lifespan, but also the healthspan¹.

Thomas Pueyo was writing about this
I still don't agree with the aging and living forever thing

But I do think it's interesting to think about and explore

Also the word healthspan is getting popular
So I think I'm with the wave
