### Key Idea

Having a society that designed the environment to make me behave in a healthy and constructive way is very beneficial

For health it's like how you can incentivize healthy behaviors by designing the enviroment

Sure, I could just spend time in cities with lots of healthy stuff that I can seek out intentionally, but a concentrated physical environment makes it so much easier ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522307276/20088760))
