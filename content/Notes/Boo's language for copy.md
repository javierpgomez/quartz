Having a tough time "going it alone" with general fitnessÂ 

Especially now with other things in life being chaotic / unstable, I didn't want to burden myself with goal-directed fitness. But not having a goal, and nobody to pull me to doing sports (and anyway it's not super accessible right now), I'm not as active as I want to be

I still have aesthetic and fitness ideals and I'm getting further away from them ðŸ™ƒ i was really happy with my progress during the pandemic. Now I'm pretty far from that and that makes me unhappy.

  

Perhaps this will partially be like therapy ðŸ˜‚
