In the world of expertise and professional pursuits, there exists a phenomenon known as "The Expert Problem," as articulated by Nassim Taleb. It's a situation where experts and meta-experts pass judgment on the work of other experts. Over time, this detachment from the practical realities of a field can lead to corruption and dysfunction. In academic circles, this has manifested as the replication crisis and the often perplexing intricacies of the humanities.

Javier's journey provides a compelling case study in this regard. His academic background exposed him to a world rich in intellectual discourse and jargon, where conferences and discussions on the latest trends in the field were commonplace. While this environment had its merits and was undeniably intellectually stimulating, it also raised a fundamental question: "What was he truly accomplishing?"

The allure of academia often lies in the cerebral discussions and theoretical explorations, but for someone like Javier, the desire to make a tangible impact in the world tugged at his ambitions. The metagame, with its focus on discussing and opining rather than "doing the job," left him seeking a more hands-on and results-driven path.

This realization led him to entrepreneurship, where the landscape is markedly different. Entrepreneurship is firmly grounded in practicality. It's about taking action, solving real-world problems, and building something from the ground up. It's an on-the-ground endeavor that demands tangible results, often in stark contrast to the academic world's propensity for abstract debates.

Javier's transition from academia to entrepreneurship represents a shift from the metagame to the game itself, where action takes precedence over discourse. It's a testament to his desire to be actively engaged in making a difference and creating a meaningful impact on people's lives.
