# My writing (250-300 words)

We think of physical fitness as something that we have to do because it's good for us.

But in history it wasn't always this way. Having a fit population had more to do with having 'able bodies' than promoting health and well being. Fitness has always been linked to war and national security

Now today we live in a period of peace, but that idea still remains

Think of how people like the idea of being fit enough for the zombie apocalypse?

Isn't that a weird thing to train for? But in light of not having a clear and present opponent- the idea of having to be fit and ready to fight is what seems to inspire a lot of people to stay in shape.

But that idea is starting to change.
