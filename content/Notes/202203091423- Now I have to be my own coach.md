# My writing (250-300 words)

Now I have to be my own coach, and that's hard

I can spend so much time thinking about systems. That when the day is over, I don't even want to work anymore. I spend all my time thinking and overthinking and trying to perfect it on the front end, that I burn out then and there.

The trick seems to be: How can I have a system where I can show up, even if it's not perfect?

Then slowly build on it and improve over time.
