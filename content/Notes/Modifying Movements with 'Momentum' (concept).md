# Modifying Movements with 'Momentum' (concept)

Source:
[[Notes/GMB Workshop- Modfiying Movement for Strength Flexibility or Control]]

- Since momentum is mass x velocity: control momentum by going slower
- Kick up into handstand is an example of this
	- You have to understand the strength
	- and you have to understand the control
	- (Think of the cartwheel bail and the handstand bail)

## Thoughts
Admittedly this is not too clear to me
