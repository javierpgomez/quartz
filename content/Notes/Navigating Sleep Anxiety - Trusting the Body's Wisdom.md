When clients or friends ask me about their struggles with sleep, particularly the concern "why can’t I sleep?" they're often pointing to the frustration of lying awake, wondering why sleep eludes them. This question usually translates to a deeper concern: "Why does it take so long for me to fall asleep?"

In my experience, both personally and professionally, I've noticed a common thread: sleep anxiety. This anxiety, the worry about not being able to sleep, ironically becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you worry, the more elusive sleep seems.

My approach, which I find essential in these situations, is fostering a sense of letting go. It's about trusting your body's natural ability to sleep. The body knows what it needs, and sometimes, our minds get in the way. Accepting this and releasing the anxiety surrounding sleep can be transformative.

It's a practice of mindfulness, of being present with the discomfort but not letting it control your actions. This acceptance doesn't mean giving up on trying to improve sleep habits; it's about changing our relationship with sleep. Understanding that while we can create conducive conditions for sleep, we can't force it.

This realization is powerful. It teaches us to trust in our body's innate wisdom and to find a balance between effort and surrender in our sleep journey. It's a gentle reminder that sometimes, the best action is to embrace patience and trust in the natural processes of our bodies.
