# My writing (250-300 words)

What is medicine really? 

I suppose the first thing that comes to mind is a pill- or some kind of pharmacuetical.

But what if we broaden our conception of what counts as medicine?

What if medicine is anything that helps your condition? Certainly a pill can do that, but there are other ways too. Movement can help. Talking to friends can help. All these things in conjunction can improve our physical health.

(There's a well known study where patients with a window recover faster after surgery- I guess a window is medicine too? Greenery is a medicine?)

The idea is that all these things work together to improve our health
