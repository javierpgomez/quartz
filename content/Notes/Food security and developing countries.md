### Key Idea

the budgets of developing regions will be increasingly concentrated on importing staple foods, with shrinking inflows of high value products such as meat, beverages and oilseeds.‚Äù

Poorer countries will import more and richer countries will import less
That's crazy
Our food security is crazy

And someone like papa is so blissfully unaware of it all
