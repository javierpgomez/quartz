# Fosbury flop and the right time (Analogy Story)

## The Story

In the 1968 summer olympics
Dick Fosbury
Fosbury flop

Different techniques in the past

It's not that no one had though about it before
But the athletes used to land on sand piles
and thus had to land on their feet

The invention of foam matting
Made it such that Dick Fosbury could be more innovative with his techniques

He also stuck to it for years
and was really persistent about it

## The Concept

[[Think of scenius not genius]]
It's a combination of cleverness
and the good circumstances that came with it

Persistent.
Even if it went against conventional practice
