# Hyper spacing in gardening

Done by experimentation 
Saw this in the MI Garderer channel

It was more of an art than a science though
how close can you space without negative effects?

Just experiment
There are books and there are rules

Note that a lot of stuff is written for industrial farming
If you're homesteading,
the rules can be different
You just have to experiment more
