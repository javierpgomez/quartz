# My writing (250-300 words)

I have a very unusual health app

It's not a sleep tracker, and it's not a step counter. It doesn't let me keep track of my calories or show me videos of workouts. 

It's an app called WeCroak

And 5 times a day, it send me a notification that says "Don't forget that you are going to die"

Maybe it's silly and morbid, but it helps keep things into perspective for me. It reminds me to be healthy for the things that matter, and not just for its own sake. The whole point of being healthy is so that I can be happy and live my life
