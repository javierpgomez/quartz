An Economic Paradigm Shift in Food Accessibility

In the quest for a healthier nation, the onus often falls on the individual. "Eat better, exercise more," they say. But what if, instead of making people hunt for healthier options, we make nutritious, delicious, and affordable food the default? Here's the kicker: healthy meals don't need a prescription, they need a platform— an economic and social one.

Unpacking the Economic Nuances

While individual effort can't be discounted, the collective endeavor carries far more weight. Why? Because not everyone has the time or resources to sift through myriad food choices. We often say 'food is medicine,' but we don't make it as readily available as a fast-food burger. It's almost like we've designed a game that's rigged against the player.

I often find myself entangled in the "food as medicine" narrative in my coaching practice. But it's not about creating a medicalized food culture; it's about making the healthy choice the easy choice. That way, I don't have to convince my clients to seek out quinoa when it's right there next to the fries. It should be a national effort to tip the scales in favor of good health.

Zooming Out: It's More Than Just Food

We're not going to overhaul the entire food system overnight, but even a small shift can create a butterfly effect. Making nutritious food the default not only addresses public health but also feeds into a more sustainable, ethical food system. It realigns our collective mindset from "food as a commodity" to "food as a community."

Why This Matters

Affordability and accessibility can no longer be the unique selling propositions of junk food. We need to inject these virtues into nutritious food options as well. Let's make the healthful choice not just an option but the default—both in our kitchens and in public policy.
