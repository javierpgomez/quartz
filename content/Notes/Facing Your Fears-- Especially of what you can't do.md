Stories like this are dramatic examples of how your ability to achieve your dreams is shaped largely by your willingness to face your fears. It might seem like these situations only arise in rare, crucial moments. But Phil Knight’s choice to face his fear is just a larger-than life version of a choice you make all the time.

**Note:** What am I afraid of, and what am I avoiding? What causes me fear and anxiety? Can I practice facing that properly?

The practice of exposure follows from what we already know about fear: the best way to get over fear is to face it. But it turns out that not all exposure is created equal—there are ways to effectively optimize your exposure so that you can maximize your chances for actually reducing your fear and making sure it doesn’t come back.

**Note:** Keep exposing yourself to scary situations- but do it in an optimal, planned out, and reflective way.

Rather than aiming for fear reduction, exposures should aim for surprise.

**Note:** This is counterintuitive and powerful. Instead of being outcome based, practice being open to surprises!

In my experience, it’s that willingness that makes the key difference. When I’m truly willing to feel the emotion, whatever was troubling me feels a little bit less imminent, and a little bit less sticky than it did before—and I’m able to move through it more fluidly.

**Note:** This is general advice on how to approach an exposure experience.
