# Idea Name

### Context / Source

But goals doesn’t always work. In fact, the evidence against them is also quite strong.

-   They are at odds with long-term progress
-   They restrict your happiness
-   They rob you of the present moment
-   They set you up for self-judgement
-   They are arbitrary
