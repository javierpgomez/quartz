# Princess Bride Swordfight is Play

This is a great example of play!

In the movie, they banter and they have fun
Their goal is clearly not outright victory
(Though they both think they can win)

So they both self handicap by fighting with their weaker hand
and it's a great scene

## Looking for a challenge

Because they're good and they want to find ways to make it interesting for themselves
So they do this. They handicap themselves

Then they start to use their dominant hand

**I actually don't remember how the fight ends

But it's about banter and having a good time

## One Punch man is the opposite

nothing is interesting to him
Because he's so strong
There's no play going on here.
There's no self handicaping going on here either
