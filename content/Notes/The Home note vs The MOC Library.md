# The [[Maps/Home]] note vs [[Maps/Library]]
The [[Maps/Home|Home]] note is like the [[1942 - Foundation Series (1942-93)|First Foundation]], while the [[Maps/Library]] note is like the Second Foundation. 

- The first foundation is about ingenuity and free will. 
- The second foundation is about structuring chaos acceptably.
