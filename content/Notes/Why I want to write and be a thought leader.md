I have a very unique background. 
I'm a mathematician, a theologian and a health coach.

Sometimes, it makes me feel like I don't really know what I'm doing, but on my better days, I can embrace how unique my blend is.

That's why I'm trying to write more and share my unique perspectives and ideas.

I know that sharing your unique ideas with the media can do three things for you: 
- Introduce you to new audiences at scale. 
- Differentiate your personal brand. and
- Build authority by having your ideas published on a third-party platform

I've explored this a little bit, but honestly I'm not quite there yet, and I still want to improve at this process.

In the meantime, I need to identify the 3 main messages that I stand for. I'm still on this journey to try and figure it out and know exactly what I want to say and for who I want to say it.

That reminds me of [Abba is Glam Rock (Create your own genre)](Notes/Abba%20is%20Glam%20Rock%20(Create%20your%20own%20genre).md). Which might seem like a really tangential idea, but it's similar in the way that you create your own specific identity and become known very clearly for a few things.
