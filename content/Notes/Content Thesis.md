## My Content Thesis

Hello, I’m Javier. I’m a Lifelong Movement Coach

I have always been curious and passionate about **Lifelong Movement** which is about **creatively staying active year to year** I care about **Moving for life** because **I myself want to be able to stay active and energetic even when I’m old and gray**

Every week, I **write/publish a newsletter** on my **website** exploring topics related to **moving for life, such as simple movements, doable habits, and the best mindset to have.**

These articles are for **long term thinkers who want to be healthy, happy and active year after year.**
