The pursuit of taste is more than a mere indulgence in sensory experiences; it is an exercise in profound attention. Echoing Simone Weil's contemplations, taste is the ability to attend to what truly matters, to distinguish not just with the mind but with the soul. It is a vigilant process of explorationâ€”of turning every stone with intention, focus, and care.

This dedication to depth brings to light the reality that taste is multifaceted and often compartmentalized. One may possess an exquisite sense for the visual arts yet find contentment in the simplest of pleasures elsewhere. It's a poignant reminder that taste, in each of its forms, requires a specific kind of attention.

Drawing upon John Folley's wisdom, we see that 'good taste' transcends mere preference, reaching for the realms of the Good and the True. It's a moral taste, where our choices are not only well-informed but aligned with the virtues of our reality.

In the spirit of Weil, true attention in taste is to be present with each choice, each preference, and each inclination, ensuring they resonate with our core values and truths. It's an active engagement that refines our being and elevates our interactions with the world.

Thus, good taste becomes a symphony of discernment, morality, and attention, where the beauty of our choices reflects the depth of our understanding.
