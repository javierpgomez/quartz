# Science changes (Concept)

## The Problem
If research is just going to change in a few years.
How can I know if what I'm doing now is the right thing?

How do I deal with it?
Who can I trust. 
What am I doing right?
What am I doing wrong? How do I know?

## Example

For example
I read a study about a good kind of diet
But then 5 years later, we realize that we were wrong about it
So there's different kinds of knowledge that we assume is true now
And then down the line it's turns out to be untrue
(Or incomplete)
