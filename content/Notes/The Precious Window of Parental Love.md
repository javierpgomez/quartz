In the journey of parenthood, there exists a magical window, a fleeting period of 8 to 12 years when you and your child become each other's absolute favorite people in the world. During this time, their eyes light up when you return home, and there's no one else they'd rather be with. It's a chapter of pure adoration.

For many parents, this window aligns with their own aging, a reminder that time marches on. It's a realization that while the depth of love and need remains unchanged, the dynamics evolve. As your child grows, so does your role as a parent.

In my case, it's when I'm 44 to 48. So I want to make this the best time of our lives. It's a time to nurture the bonds of love and create lasting memories that will endure beyond this magical phase.
