In my journey through both personal and professional landscapes, I've encountered an invisible yet formidable barrier that Anne-Laure Le Cunff aptly identifies as the self-consistency fallacy. This concept resonates deeply with me, highlighting a struggle I've faced time and again: the tendency to cling to the familiar narrative of my past decisions, thereby limiting my capacity for growth and adaptation.

The self-consistency fallacy is a pervasive mindset, subtly dictating our choices under the guise of coherence and stability. It's the unseen director of our life's play, convincing us to repeat the same lines, assume the same roles, and follow the same paths, all in the name of consistency. Yet, what strikes me most is the realization of how this fallacy has shaped my own decisions, often at the expense of exploring new horizons.

Consistently erring on the side of consistency has been my modus operandi, a safety net that, upon reflection, has sometimes acted more as a cage. The fallacy's grip is tightest at crossroads where the potential for change is greatest. Here, the allure of the known and the tested overshadows the uncertain and the novel, stifling the possibility of transformation and the discovery of uncharted territories of my capabilities and interests.

Breaking free from this mental shackling requires a conscious effort to recognize and challenge the underlying biases that favor the status quo. It's about questioning the validity of the narrative that "I have always done it this way, so I must continue to do so." This introspection has led me to ponder deeply about the opportunities I've dismissed for their lack of alignment with my past, the new paths I've overlooked, and the ideal visions of my career and life that I've yet to entertain seriously.

The essence of overcoming the self-consistency fallacy lies in the realization that we are, indeed, verbs and not nounsâ€”dynamic, evolving, and capable of rewriting our stories in more vibrant, diverse, and unexpected ways. Embracing this mindset is to accept that change is not only possible but necessary for growth. It's a commitment to being open to the "weird" projects, the fun ideas, and the collaborations that may not fit neatly into the current trajectory but promise learning, growth, and, most importantly, the excitement of the unknown.

As I reflect on this journey of self-discovery and change, I am reminded of the richness that lies in diversity of experience and the strength that comes from adaptability. Moving forward, my aim is to navigate life with a curiosity that embraces change, challenges consistency, and welcomes the squiggly, strange stories yet to be told. In doing so, I hope to break free from the self-imposed constraints of past decisions and embark on a path defined by growth, flexibility, and the courage to explore the vast potential of what I can become.
