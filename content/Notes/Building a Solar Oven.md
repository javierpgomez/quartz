# Building a Solar Oven

## The concept here
It's about using energy.
There's so much energy that goes to waste
We have to keep harvesting energy
Use the sun and the right angle

## Example

In Brad Lancaster's youtube video on Kirsten Durst youtube's channel
He has a solar oven on his property.

It's like a slow cooker I think. 
And he rotates it to hit the sun.

Kinda useful.

## Applying it to the Philippines

I think you could do it here during certain months.
Aiming it towards the sun somehow.
It would be curious to see how he gets that design

Like how does he make the hinges that work.
And what's in the box?
It's a fun little thing to think about

One day it'll be a good project to do
