### Key Ideas

The whole idea is that if you come from a place of fear, then money won't come easy or writing won't come easy, or farming won't come easy.

This is interesting because I'm linking it now to [[Permaculture MOC]] and how permaculture is all about abundance and not scarcity.

It may not be exactly 1-1 because this is about money while the other is about farming. But I think there's something to it. When [[Mark Shepard]] talks about farming, he makes it sound easy and effortless. He's built a system where it just comes naturally. And I think it all has to be similar to that.
