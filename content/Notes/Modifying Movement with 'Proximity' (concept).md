# Modifying Movement with 'Proximity' (concept)

Source:
[[Notes/GMB Workshop- Modfiying Movement for Strength Flexibility or Control]]

- One way to get this idea immediately is to think that "tighter is lighter"
	- The closer things are to your center of gravity, the easier it is to lift
- Examples:
	- Elbows in
	- Squeeze your body
- If you combine this with a solid base
	- see [[Notes/Modifying Movement with 'Base' (concept)]]
	- Then it's easier to transition
		- Solid base + tight proximity = easy transition
- changing the proximity can change the difficulty
