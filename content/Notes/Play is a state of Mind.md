What is the difference between Exercise and Play?

Are some activities always Exercise?
- Like running, going to the gym, yoga classes? 
- All those traditional exercises?

Is Play more free flow? 
- Like sports, or dance?
- Anything where there are less rigid rules?

## I think it is not about the activity. I think it's about the mindset you have

Sometimes when I'm going on a long walk, I have a lot on my mind. Even though I think of hiking as play, if I'm in a place of stress and anxiety, it doesn't feel relaxing. It feels like a chore.

I've definitely gone on hikes where I was just putting one foot in front of the other and NOT enjoying myself at all.

On the other hand, I've been at the gym where I'm so present and in the zone. I am aware of each movement. I start noticing my body and muscles in ways I did not before. I start to feel relaxed and curious.

That definitely is play for to me.

Other times, when I'm at the gym- I'm so present and completely aware of each of my movements. I start noticing things in my muscles that I didn't before. I feel present and curious!
That's more like play.

Every movement, every activity can be play- if you bring the right attention to it.

## The 3 ways that I practice play

When was the last time you moved because you wanted to? Just for its own sake?

We can get caught up in the benefits of exercise, that it starts to feel like a chore- and not something that I want to do.

How can I make a movement playful more myself?

## 1. Setting aside play time

The best way to give my mind the space to play is to commit to a set time.

It can be 15 minutes, it can be 1 hour. Either way, I tell myself
"These 15 minutes are just to play. No phones. No work. Nothing else but this"

That way when I'm playing, I get to be fully present. I'm not really worried about what I need to do next- or where I have to go. I can just set a timer, start playing and just immerse myself in it.

And when the alarm sounds I can go back to my work

## 2. 'Sensing' my Activity

My mind is always racing around- thinking about what needs to be done next.

So I practice play by trying to sense everything there is about my activity.

If I'm lifting weights, I might ask:
"How do the weights feel in my hand?"
"What textures do I notice on the gym equipment?"

If I'm going for swim, I'll notice:
"Is the water hot or cold?"
"What do I taste when I'm immersed?"
"What sounds do I notice when I'm underwater?"

These kinds of questions snap me back to what I'm doing. And it helps me get into a play state of mind.

## 3. Using Creativity and Curiosity

I also like to mess around. (As long as I know it's safe)

When I'm playing, I'll build on what I'm sensing and I'll see what I can change.

For example, if I'm hiking I might say:
"What if I close my eyes for a few seconds"
"What if I walk backwards? What if I add a little skip to my step?"
"What if I notice the unevenness of the ground?"

If I'm doing pushups, I might try:
"What if I position my hands differently?""
"Can I do it? Does it feel safe? Does it change the exercise?"
"Is it easier or harder? What am I learning about my body?"

These little things keep my mind in the zone. And let me discover new things about my body or my environment. It's not just the same each time.
