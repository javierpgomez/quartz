# My writing (250-300 words)

Pyschological reactance is how when someone tells you to do something, you may feel less inclined to do it.

You're actually better off if that person lets you feel like you have a choice. This is what I used to do for my students back when I was teaching.

I would give them options, and make it like a choose your own adventure.
