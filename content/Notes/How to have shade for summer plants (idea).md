# How to have shade for summer plants (idea)

## context
In the summer it gets unbearable hot here.

## Why it matters
Extend your growing season a bit
Or you can just rest your garden

## Some solutions
I think some kind of netting would be good
- I went overboard in my vision and was thinking of netting the whole garden
- But I only need to net some parts
- Like the "raised bed" parts
