**Play as Survival Training**

For children, play is not mere leisure; it's akin to a survival course. Like many intelligent animals, kids possess an inherent desire to play, equipping them with the physical, emotional, and social toolkits crucial for life.

**Independence Through Play**

According to Peter Gray, free play and exploration historically serve as avenues for children to grasp problem-solving, gain control over their lives, and cultivate personal interests. It's as if nature designed this 'curriculum' to produce fully functional adults.

**1st Person Insight**

This resonates with me because I feel like adults, including myself, have unlearned how to play. The idea of minimal adult control also speaks to the wider concept of autonomy, something I advocate for in my coaching practice. We need to trust the process of play, not just for kids but for adults, to rediscover skills and emotional resilience that are second nature during childhood but get buried under life's complexities.

**Adult Supervision: A Constraint?**

Interestingly, children see play as something that transpires with minimal adult involvement. The presence of an adult turns the "play" into something elseâ€”perhaps a "task" or a "lesson." The takeaway? True play happens in unstructured, minimally supervised spaces, allowing for organic growth and learning.

**Why This Matters**

Reintroducing play into our lives can be a bridge to wellness and improved mental health. If adults can step back and let children explore through play, maybe adults can give themselves the same freedom. Play could very well be the missing link in a balanced, mentally sound life.
