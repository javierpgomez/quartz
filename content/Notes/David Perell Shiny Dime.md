# David Perell Shiny Dime

Start your article with a shiny dime
(What's this concept?)

Like there's an interesting concept
That's small
and interesting
And enough that you can zoom in on
Don't try to be so big and abstract
Start with something really small and interesting

Balance novelty and focus
