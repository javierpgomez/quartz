# Where to allocate your energy

This can be related to that graph
the double dip graph
![[Notes/Double Dip Graph of Productivity.png]]
from the Perel video with Anne-Laure Le Cunff

You can choose where you want to be

Embrace the suck for some people
to get to the second bump

But it's okay to be in the first too

If you're a top performer, get into that second peak
but if you have other things in your life going on
stay in that first peak
