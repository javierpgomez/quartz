# Atomic Story Note

*Why wasn't he serious about his work and other priorities? Why did he immediately indulge in anything remotely interesting, abandoning everything he had on his plate? Why was life a joke to him?*

##### Audrey however was the polar opposite

She was meticulous about every move and decision. She'd take hours to decide the colour of curtains that'd go well with her furniture. Antoine, meanwhile would have changed his house twice.

##### "Can I see your ticket please?"  The ticket inspector's voice jolted Audrey back to the present.

She gazed out of the train window. She was still confused about Antoine's voice message. It said "Hey Audrey. We need to see each other as soon as possible before I embark on my new project."

##### And he left an address. It was a hospital. *A hospital? Is he working as a nurse now?*

As soon as she got there, she learnt Antoine had left. A kind nurse with puffy eyes handed her a note

##### "Hi Audrey, you're late again. But never mind. Here's a small gift for you. Love, Antoine"

Audrey's heart ached as she took the photo album in her hand. It brimmed with photos of a frowning Audrey and a grinning Antoine since the day they met.

##### Audrey wiped away tears. *The poor devil knew how to live.*
