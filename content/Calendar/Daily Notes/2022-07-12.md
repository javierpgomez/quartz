### Journaling and writing

As she stopped to catch her breath, she looked back and kept on running and running and running. 

She was getting really tired, but the villain was right there behind her. So she was getting tired. And she was trying to figure out what was going on.

What was she afraid of? what was chasing her? it wasn't very clear or apparent. She had no idea what it was. It looked like a person.

But it turns out it wasn't even a person at all. It was a shadowy figure. The fear of pain. And fear was driving the pain. It was making her tense up, and protect herself, even when there was nothing to fear.

So in the end, she was just tired and afraid all the time. Afraid of what was behind her. Afraid of what was ahead of her. She was not able to move.

And she could feel it in her body. The clenched fists. The clenched jaws. All the nervousness and anxiety that plagued her all the time.

It wasn't clear what the way out was. And how she could make any progress in her life. She was quite simply. Stuck. Very absolutely, terribly and painfully stuck.

and now that she felt stuck? What was the solution? What was the cure? To move somehow. To realize that it's okay to try something (anything) Just to get moving. And to believe that there is actually hope in getting unstuck.

I've been working so hard for so long. And I feel like I've been left alone by my peers and the people around me. I just feel very stuck.

And I don't know who to work with. And how to move forward. And what my next step could be. And how I can make some changes or improvements. I don't want to feel like I don't know what my next step is.

I need to keep writing and I need to keep making progress. There's absolutely no other way around this.

This reminds me of when I was still stuck in my addiciton. And i didn't really know how to get out, or what the way forward was.

It was just this. And now I feel completely stuck and lost. And I don't know what else to do- and how else to be. And what other things I can make that will help me reach where I want to go.
