### Positive Intelligence Grant
Biggest goals and challenges as a coach

I started Fitforlife because I was unhappy with the health coaching landscape. There's so much focus on quick fixes, hacks and aesthetics.

I want to build a coaching business that focuses on the mindsets and behaviors to help people build lifelong health.

I've been working on this for 1 year, and though the budget is tight, I am enjoying the work. So apart from coaching well, I want to build this into a sustainable source of income.

Right now I am building an online community to coach more people, but I find the business side of it very challenging.

The PQ grant will help me practice becoming a better coach, and incorporate some powerful frameworks and language into my work.

It will also help me meet other coaches in the industry, build accountability, and learn from how other people run their businesses.

Thank you for the opportunity!
