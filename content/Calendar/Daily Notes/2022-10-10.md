If you've been injured and have gone through physiotherapy, you may still be afraid to move around and do the things you love. This can be a big problem, and it can prevent you from fully recovering.

  

I understand how frustrating and scary this can be. I also know that you want to get better and move on with your life. That's why I'm here to help.

  

As a recovery coach, I will help you get unstuck, unafraid, and moving again.

  

I'll work with you to help you overcome your fear and get back to living your life to the fullest.
