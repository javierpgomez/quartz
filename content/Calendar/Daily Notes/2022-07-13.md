What did I work on today?

I built a bunch of templates today. And those were good to work on. I feel like I learned a lot in today's work, and I'm actually quite proud of it

What did I learn today?

### **Thoughts on being a creator in health**

I struggle to present myself as this kind of expert know it all
- Because I don't like the tone, and it's not really a one size fits all kind of thing.
- So it's been a struggle crafting my voice
- Because I can't really appear as an expert all the time

A lot of it still is about writing a lot

I'm not writing as much as I would like to be

There's the mental hurdle of just making the damn thing
and selling the damn thing

There's so much going on in health

So it's a lot like building my unique perspective
