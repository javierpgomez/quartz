I want to start coaching LESS people

As I grow, I know EXACTLY who I want to help as a fitness coach
It's people who are afraid to trust their body

What does that mean?

I know what it feels like when your body isn't working the way you want it to. It's frustrating.

When this happened to me, it took years to get back to confidence and movement. I don't want it to take so long for you.

I help you trust your body again, recover your confidence and own your physical recovery. 

If you're stuck in an injured version of yourself, I can help you to get back to your worry-free active self.

I believe in you and I know that you can recover. 

Let's get started on your journey back to confidence and movement.
