## **What do I want to work on today:**
I should do a bit for the worksheets
But honestly I'm super tired

### Morning Journal 
**Freewrite**
I should do a bit for the worksheets today
and then template the newsletter that I'll send out tomorrow
And Maybe get started writing on Linkedin

But I should have my digital assets good to go
Because that's where I get stuck the most
So that I can just share that with people.
And I don't get so stuck
With community community

The worksheets are really the key kasi
It's a bit like what I was doing with FFL and DLSZ
Running these workshops and such
Is it something that the customers even wanted
Is it something that's useful for them

How is it helpful?
And what can they learn?
How can this help them and help them build on something?
I'm not so clear on what to do there
