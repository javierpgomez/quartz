So I gained weight and rounded out while I was traveling in Europe. I don't notice it but a few people have told me I look fuller than before. 

Obviously I'm not an athlete anymore.
So I can't measure my health just based on how I look and how I perform

But the thing is I don't feel unhealthy, but I realized I don't have good measures on my health.

And it led me to think this week about how I would measure my health in my life now.

What about now?
How am I meaningfully measuring health?

Coping with stress

I've talked about struggling with stress management before. Ever since the pandemic, my body has struggled to find it's balance (even leading to a few chronic pain issues)

I'm putting this at #2 because stress management for me has become such a major factor in living a happy healthy life.

I'm practicing making it more of a priority
