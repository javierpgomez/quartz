I'm not starting out
This is a good reframe
You're doing well

My take - You're not just starting out. You're taking your years of experience and packaging it a little differently. You have thousands of hours on anyone attending in terms of learning, researching, applying, teaching, training & coaching. The only thing you lack at this point is reps at presenting it in this format.
