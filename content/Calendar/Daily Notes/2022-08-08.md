## Morning Journal 

### **What do I want to work on today:**

I want to prepare for my workshop- that's definitely top of mind for me
Then there's other business things to work on
And I have to keep doing my interviews
And then at some point, 
I'm going to have to transcribe those interviews
And actually put them into practice somehow
I also need to message Dustin
and give him an update as to how things are going for me

### **Freewrite**

There feels like so much to do
I've got the Ship30
I've got the PQ stuff
I had my book
I have an email course
I have my atomic essays
I have my Deploy empathy essays
I have my writing on chronic pain
I have my testimonials
I have my writing to do

So I need to keep writing again
Publish things
Schedule things
Figure out what I'd like to do
What goes viral and what works well for people

What is good, and what's part of my walled garden
What kind of ecosystem is good for people and what people like to see

Teaching and teaching how to homestead and how to farm
What one can learn from farming and permaculture
Where are the scientists
What are the different techniques that people use
