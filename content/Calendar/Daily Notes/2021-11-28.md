I feel like my system is far too much on ideas and not enough on practical steps.
How to make it practical?
Like what are the teachings and practices that can get you into these principles?
You need some kind of specific practice or activity that can help you get into this mindset

It's like how in GMB, we help people get into the right frame of mind

--

What can I give?

I can talk about consistency
I can talk about just getting started
I can talk about movement over exercise

Reassurance that it's going to be okay.
(This isn't something sustainable)
