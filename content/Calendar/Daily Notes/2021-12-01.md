[Ridgeview Floor Area](Notes/Ridgeview%20Floor%20Area.md)

Write everyday
Publish 3 tweets a day - frontload all of this
Do some threads now and then
Then publish on Medium

What if I repeat myself on threads? I don't think that's really a problem
It's not top down
it just kind of organically comes together

So you just write and publish and see what happens

Seems like it's time to do batching
- i.e. all soc med posts batched
	- every

- writing is daily
