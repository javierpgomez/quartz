## Irresistible Offer

---

Injury and physical pain
to get back into confidence in your body
and play and move again
Continue to work with you until your feel safe and confident in your body

---

They want that outcome:
- or in health: Get back to movement and play!

**A helpful question: How many "no's" are you willing to take until you get to your "yes"**

If you're not back to play and movement in 8 weeks
then I'll give you a complete refund
without any questions asked

---

Rajie: "You are a 30 year old guy who got injured and wants to get back into action"
and is thinking of getting back into action

I help people who are stuck in physical injury
use mental fitness to trust their body again
and get back to movement and play
Offer: "Do you know someone who fits this description?"

**Know what I want?
And I know what's next?**

**Focus on outcomes and remove the risk**

---

Thoughts on please don't tell:
- Would love to have that kind of word of mouth
- Surprise and delight
- You just get a lot of fun stuff

I think removing the risk makes it really easy to do
- No brainer decision to grow
- time bound

---
I saw a person online complain about pain

What would I like to offer them
That will cost them nothing

6 weeks to mental fitness for injury
15 minutes a day
1 hour pre-recorded webinar from Shirzad (on mental fitness)
1 hour a week live with Coach Javier (on the body and the mind)

My videos to start you out

---

Once you’re cleared by your physio, my expertise is on keeping you safe, strong, and empowered. When you’re ready, you’re going to want to trust someone to help get you there. I care. I have experience. And I’ll be here each step of the way with you.

Remember, their fear is getting hurt again. However, if they’ve been cleared, the real struggle and/or fear is getting reinjured again. Let them know that you got them. 

Balance, empathy with conviction that you’re the right person. And, after a while, if they don’t trust that, move on. Like a cute girl at a bar. Chase a little and then maybe at some point it’s just not right girl.
