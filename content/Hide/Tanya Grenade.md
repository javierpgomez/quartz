I think the part in module 2 goal setting where it’s says “Figuring out what you want to be doing when you’re retired”

Could it be figuring out what you want to be doing throughout your life span/health span? 

As would this be the same as what I’m doing now? As the health span is continuous so if I keep doing consistently what I’m doing now I should be able to keep doing it.   

Or if there’s something I can’t do now (e.g balance on one leg) (falls prevention) then I need to put things in place now to work towards it. 

As sometimes I think there is a preoccupation with retirement as the time that people pin their dreams on. As they will have time. 

But if you wait that long you may not be able to do it. So it’s best to try things now.

As I think it depends upon the affluence of the people that do your course. As some people can’t retire so they will work till they die. 

Whereas others are able to plan for retirement and will be able to take it easy. And do fun things. 

But health inequalities in older age is a separate thing but does have a big impact on health in older age.
