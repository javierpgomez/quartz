## Art of the Close

### Key Ideas

**I help people who are stuck in an Injured version of themselves get back to confidence and movement and trusting your body again by believing and owning that you're better**

**I help people stuck in a physical injury build up mental fitness to trust their body again**

**Test Close**
- What value did you get from today's coaching session?
- What did you like the most about today's coaching session?
- How will you move forward after our session today?
- What resources and accountability do you have (or are already in place) to ensure you continue your forward momentum?
- Is coaching a form of support that would serve you?
- Would you like to hear what working with me as your coach is like?

We're doing this session because I want you to experience coaching the way I do coaching!
There are so many variants

If price were a no brainer, on a scale of 1-10 (getting more feedback)

**My Offer**
I receive $1000
for 8 coaching sessions 
where we'll meet once a week
that are 60 minutes in length

I work best with clients who are decisive and take bold action. Do you see yourself as the kind of person that goes after something when you know you want it

I think you'd make an excellent client based on our work here today.

**IF YES**

**IF MAYBE**

I prefer coaching decisive people as they tend to be more successful. What additional information would you need to make an informed decision today?

Unless this is an absolute yes for you, let's leave it today being totally clear that it's a no. That way, if the desire begins to build in you to be coached you can come back to me. But only when you're ready.

**IF NO**
- How can you understand what I've been going through?


**Other questions**

How would you measure if it's something that's been working?

**Other notes**
- I could connect you to those performers
- I can leverage my story
	- How I got injured and where I am now

- **What if a person wants to be coached, but is not exactly in my niche**
- Trust
