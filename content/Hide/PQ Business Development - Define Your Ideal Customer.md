## Define your ideal customer

### Here's a great idea for thinking about my customer
The Bullseye: **One ideal customer**
One ring out: **A niche - the tribe that person is in**
And another ring out: **Other tribes that I have the skills to work with**

### A visualization of my ideal customer


She want to just move and get on with her life. She's tired of feeling pain and having to build her life around it. It's just so exhausting. So she hopes she can get back to work. To travel without having to worry about her health. Just to be able to enjoy herself. And not have to worry about her body. 

"I miss being pain free. I miss not having any fear at all. I love spending time with friends. I actually love my work. I find it interesting and it keeps me motivated also.""

Maybe even go to the gym, wouldn't that be nice. To do some real workouts that I enjoy and that keep me happy. Just to not have to worry anymore. That would be great
