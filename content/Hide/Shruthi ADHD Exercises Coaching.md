Key Ideas for people with ADHD
- ADHD decision making is overwhelming. Everything feels important. So you're likely to stop in the middle of exercise to do something that feels important
- ADHD thinking tends to be all or nothing
- ADHD needs to keep the limbic brain entertained

**Overall**
- My health is important (for this hour)
- So I will focus on it

**For ADHD decision making:**
1. Pre-decide to help your future self
Try to not make decisions in the moment, it will become overwhelming. 

- Choose ahead of time
- Set Alarms and Reminders (do them as soon as it sounds)

2. Anchor it with specifics
- Anchor in time: when will you do it
- Anchor a process: be specific. What will you do first? Then what next?
- Anchor with Accoutnabiltiy: With who will you do it? Who will you tell?

3. Follow the leader
Reduce decision making for your exercise by having videos / programs that you just have to follow

- Have playlists of workouts
- Have go-to videos, audio etc

**ALL or NOTHING THINKING**

1. Think in trial peroids (2 weeks)
- You don't have to do 1 exercise forever
- Try for 2 weeks, see if you like it. Then move on

2. Have a clear minimum target
- Use this statement as a model: 
"I will feel good if I can do X at least X days a week." 
Then make the lower control limit your target.

3. Have options and backup plans

Set these up as IF-THEN scripts (don't choose in the moment)

IF __ THEN Plan A
IF __ THEN Plan B
IF __ THEN Plan C


**KEEPING THE BRAIN ENTERTAINED**

1. Temptation bundling
- If you find exercise tedious, link it to something fun and rewarding.
- Ex. Podcasts, favorite music, TV Shows

2. Have fun (see also Think in trial peroids)
- Do something new and fun every 2 weeks
