## Know Your Niche

### Key Ideas

When I talk about my niche, does my sage get excited?
Who are the people that I want to help out?

### Feb 20 (Doing Work with Jeff Glauser)

Character: 
- Men in their 40s who want to become 
Character Want: 
- a past healthy version of themselves. 

Problem: 
- Life became difficult, which caused them to lose focus and sacrifice their physical/mental/spiritual health
- As a result, they now feel overwhelmed, out of control, uncertain, unconfident, and isolated. And what worked before no longer works anymore. 

You deserve better

Philosophical Statement: 
- Even when life gets hard, I believe that maintaining your health doesn’t have to be. 
- There’s more to health than just your body. **You deserve to be strong in mind, body, and spirit.**

Guide: 
- Empathy: You’ve dealt with your own share of physical struggles. Former athlete, chronic pain due to stress, lost your direction.

and what I discovered was
This is the formula that I can share with you

- Authority: You possess a unique blend of philosophy and physical education. You’re purpose driven and vision oriented. 

The Plan: 
- Statement: Recalibrate your understanding of what health is fundamentally.
- **Name your package!** 
	**- The Balanced Body Blueprint**
		**- discovery Sketch your Body Blueprint**
	- **The Imperfect Health Roadmap**
		-discovery **Health Mastery Mapping**
	- **The Balanced Health Blueprint**
		- discovery **- Sketch your Body Blueprint**
	- **The Radical Health Reset**
		- 	discovery **Mindful Health Mapping**
- Plan summary: 
	- 1. Book a **discovery call**
	- 2. Discuss your mind-body-spirit solution
	- 3. Determine your health goals
	- 4. Begin your 12-week habit plan (nutrition vs. exercise focused) 
	- Reach your goals and regain control of your confidence/certainty/life! 

1. Assessment during a discovery call
2. discuss your mind-body-spirit solution
3. Assign you on a 12-week habit focused plan
4. Reach your health transformation

Call to Action: 
- Direct = Book a discovery call 
- Transitional = A PDF or other document of value that can be accessed upon providing contact info

**What do successful results look like?**

Independent
- Freedom
- Autonomy
- Confident
- Control of your health and life
- Mastery of your health

-- 
increased discipline
continuoud progress
mastery of daily routine
new ambitions
secure in their skin

After we work together, you'll feel confident to keep working on your help- even without my close supervision! 

You'll be more aware of your thoughts and behaviors on your health, and you'll be able to catch yourself when you're getting stuck in limiting beliefs or self-sabotaging health patterns.

Ultimately, you'll feel in control over your health.

**- Identify what tragic results/failure looks like if they don’t take action**

If you don't take action, you'll get stuck in a negative health spiral.

Forget the increased risk of disease, aches and pains, and a shorter lifespan. 

The worst part is that you'll feel lost, adrift, completely out of control- to the point of despair. 

You'll get stuck believing that it's too late, there's nothing you can do, and that your health is just doomed.

**- Identify an Identity Transformation (From X to Y)**** 

From victim to victor

From stuck to sustainable

From sitting on the sidelines to star

**From sidelines to star**

From resigned to resurging

From isolated to connected

From overwhelmed to in control

From anxious to in-control

From uncertainty to clarity

From a dark moment to a happily ever after

### Who do I have empathy for?

After working with dozens of clients over the years

And really want to help

### Oct 2022 Niche Statements

----

*I want to help you come back from injury and get moving again 🏃‍♀️🦴

And if you've gone through the physical therapy, but still feel afraid and worried about your body then you're the one I want to help*

---

You know that it's a good niche when you have a good sage reaction. It's something that makes me feel really good. And I'm so happy to talk about it and share it with other people

Met with [[Notes/Jill Hawkins]]

### Nov 2022 Me working on my niche

- I like to work with people stuck in an injury mindset
	- people who have been injured
	- and I want to help them find movement that they love
- I want them to feel hopeful
- I don't want them to feel frustrated

When people are stuck in old injuries, they end up feeling frustrated and stuck
- Hopelessly stuck from old injuries
- There are some people who are stuck in old injuries

The 2nd breakout room was with
[[Joshua Froc]] and [[Laura Lind-Blum]]

### Nov 2022 Here's a good Niche Statement

**I help people who are stuck in an Injured version of themselves get back to confidence and movement and trusting your body again by believing and owning that you're better**

### My Final Niche Statement *as of Nov 2022*

**I help people stuck in a physical injury build up mental fitness to trust their body again**

### Here's a fuller write up that I can use

Are you struggling to get back to activity after injury?

Even though you've been through physical therapy and seen doctors

Is there something that's still holding you back?

- Do not feel afraid, do not feel uncertain, go back to the lifestyle you used to live
- Is diet and health part of it?
- Is mindset shift part of it?
- Minimizing the chances of it happening again

---- 

People who had single injuries
Doing the things they love to do
Have gone to the doctor
have seen physical therapists
Still feel like they're stuck and afriad
So I'll help them feel less afraid
Bring their bodies back to what it used to be
And help prevent it from happening again
So that they can go back to doing the things they love

----

### When I was talking to [[Notes/Reid Hamilton]]

He used the term patient mentality

That's someone who has been cleared to play, but is stuck mentally. They're still being overly careful and still holding back.

**Some copy**
Are you stuck in a patient mentality?

You've been cleared to play,
You've been injured-
You went to the doctor, they did some tests
You had some physical therapy.

But you just can't get back
You feel afraid
You feel tentative
You're hesitant to really go all the way

That's where I can come in
Get your mindset back to where it used to be

----

### Dec 2022 What about my Niche thoughts?

Originally, I said that I wanted to help people who were having trouble trusting their body again after injury.

But I was having too much difficulty finding these people

-       Because I’m not a PT
-       I don’t know too many physical therapists.
-       So even though I feel like I have empathy for this group, I don’t know if I can really help them out
-       Or if I can attract them
-       Maybe I need to fix my language

I originally chose this, Because it fits my own journey.
I was writing for a previous version of myself.
But it's not really my life anymore?
Because I'm not an athlete anymore
So there's a weird credibility gap that's going on there.

For my own journey, it was 
-       I was an athlete
-       And I finished that part of my life

-       And then I struggled to transition to an active
-       Long term life
-       One that is focused on longevity, health, sustainability
-       I’m not really about making my life longer per se
-       But making the time that I have worthwhile
-       Not to end it prematurely.
-       For example, if I’m given 90 years. I don’t care to extend it to 100
-       But I don’t want to end it at 80
-       And with those 90 years, I want to make it as good and meaningful as I possibly can
-       So when I have a kid. We can play
-       When I’m old, I can move and farm
-       Make my life good and worthwhile and meaningful

### Jan 2023 Diving Deeper into Niche Work - While at Nissan

**There’s a burning house and I want to help somebody.**

Who is the person that I want to help the most??
Is it dads?
Is it athletes?
It’s people like me?
Who are people like me?
I don’t want to be intense. I just want to be a bit healthier.

I want to have the chance to enjoy my life.

**Who are you? Who will I help**
Men in the 40s- Rediscover movement in their bodies.
Enjoy movement again.
Not feel in so much pain.
Be able to move and enjoy their movements.

--

**I’ve been thinking about new dads.**

And helping them get into more movement.
Look, there’s a small window when you can play on the ground with your kids
And when that window passes, it’s closed forever
(or you can have another kid)
So what’s my goal. To get you playing on the ground with your kid.
I’m here to help you rediscover movement.
Whatever is appropriate for whatever part of life you’re in.
So when I say fitforlife, it’s just about staying moving all the time.

Hey, you used to move in your 20s in one way.
Now it’s not going to be that exactly again.
There’s things that you have windows for movement for
And you have to do the most you can with your body in that window

How to make use of those windows?
Sprinting? Really high intensity running?
That window is in your 20s to early thirties
Hiking, you have a bigger window
Swimming you have a bigger window
Scuba diving? (My window has closed)
You have a window for some activities

-       Be aware of your window
And choose based on that
-       This is a concept that honestly is a big rich for people to understand
-       Increase your window.
-       On how long you can play and help people
Your kids will only be able to play with you on the ground for a certain window.
Here’s the window
You have to make it work.

New fathers- who want to play with their kids.
On the ground
Who haven’t had any movement in a long time
And are just thinking about how I can play with them on the ground.
There’s a window where a kid cares to play
And when that window closes, it’s closed forever.
(Or you can have a new kid)
Enjoy your travel window
Enjoy your diving window
Dive as much as you can while you can.
Make the most of your hobby windows

The dad window is really important
When was the last time you hung from some rails.
I want to be a good dad.

**Who are underserved?**

They definitely serve people who are already inclined to be active.
But what about people who don’t care for it at all?
How to help those people?
If people are motivated, then they’ll get it done.

**What if you’re not motivated?**

Normally I don’t care to work with those people.
I want to work with people who are highly motivated for their health.
Because I don’t want to worry about motivating people.
But it would help to make it easy for people to be active and motivated.

**Reinvent your health**
Again and again
I was a track athlete,
Then I was a weightlifter
Then I was a diver
Now I’m a hiker
I do calisthenics
I do different things
I just like to explore what my body can do
Is there any wisdom here?
Any framework here that can be followed?

**For new dads**

Who want to just play with their kids.
Who do I have a lot of empathy for?
People who are really struggling with their health.
It feels like nothing they do I correct
And that’s it’s always ups and downs.
Always a struggle
Always a struggle
That’s tough honestly.

### Another Niche Statement [[2022-01-20]]

**I help new dads - 
go from -- "worrying about their body"
- who cannot crawl on the ground
- who cannot squat down
- who can't even carry

Fathers new dads who have neglected their body for most of their life or a long time
and now suddenly care about being healthy for their family

to having confidence in their ability to move and play and be there for their children.


**who realize they want to play with their kids**

-- They wake up when they have kids

I help new dads 
who have neglected their body for a long time
and today care about being healthy for their kids

Go for how it feels 100 lbs ago
Go for how it feels 

### Jan 2023 Niche work again

So that's where I'd like to be in a year, two years, three years. 
But I also want it to matter. 

You know, I want to be stronger. 
I want to be able to do stuff when I get older. 
I don't just want to get bigger.
I want to be able to never enter a competition. 
I'm not here to enter the strong man competition. 
But like I never want to hurt. 
I want to be able to chop wood in my backyard. 
I want to be able to carry stuff around. 
I want to be able to travel with a backpack
