Can technology teach me to pace?

### Key Idea

[Visible](https://www.makevisible.com/) is an activity tracking platform for illness, not fitness. Think Fitbit, but the total opposite! Instead of telling you to move when you’ve been sitting still for too long, it will tell you when when you’re overexerting and need to rest.
