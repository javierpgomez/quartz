I love to walk.

So here's another reason for me to keep doing it.

That's interesting because I know that walking does wonders for the brain, and I'm always finding ways to walk more and more. 

That reminds me of when [[I did a 12-hour walk last year]]. Which was a powerful experience that helped me reframe my experience. It's definitely nothing compared to when [[I walked 1000km in 33 days]] but, having a shorter 1-day version was a powerful tool in my kit.

It's important because we were made to move. And the more we move the more our brain fires up. Move more, so that you can think more!
