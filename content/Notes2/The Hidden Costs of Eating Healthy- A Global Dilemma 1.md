**The Illusion of Choice**

While it's easy to preach about the importance of a healthy diet, the reality is that for many, this is an unattainable luxury. More than 3.1 billion people couldn't afford a healthy diet in 2021. The pandemic has only exacerbated this, increasing the cost by nearly 7%. This isn't just a statistic; it's a crisis that I see unfolding in my own community in the Philippines.

**The Myth of Subsistence Farming**

Contrary to popular belief, rural communities in places like Africa aren't primarily relying on subsistence farming. They're also consuming processed foods, including highly processed ones. This dispels the notion that eating healthy is merely a matter of choice or effort. The food landscape is more complex and fraught with challenges than we often acknowledge.

**The Volatility of Food Prices**

Farmers and rural populations are more exposed to food price volatility and hunger than previously thought. This isn't just an issue for consumers; it's a systemic problem that affects the entire food supply chain. It's a vicious cycle where the vulnerable become more vulnerable.

**Why This Matters to Me**

As a health coach, I can't ignore the systemic barriers that make healthy eating a Herculean task for many. It's not just about personal willpower or making better choices; it's about a system that often makes the unhealthy option the most accessible and affordable one. This is a call to action for me to think more broadly about how to make health and wellness more equitable.
