We use our feet a lot in our daily lives, whether it's walking, running, or even just standing. 

However, our hands are often neglected in comparison. 

Crawling, grabbing, hanging, and using them for intricate work are all important ways we use our hands, but these activities have become less common in our modern lives. Instead, the main things we use our hands for now are typing and driving. It's important to remember to nourish our hands and make sure they are getting the exercise they need to stay strong and healthy. This can include simple exercises like squeezing a stress ball or doing hand stretches. By taking care of our hands, we can ensure that they will be able to continue to serve us well in all the ways we need them to.

It's similar because they're both talking about the importance and benefits of using your hands for all that stuff.
It's different because well. it's not that much different. I just seem to often take a modern life perspective
It's important because we need these kinds of movements if we are going to be healthy human beings.
