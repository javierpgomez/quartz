# Writing, Fear, and Tightening (Blog draft)

Links to a [[Bird by Bird]] quote

It’s a mechanic in the way our bodies work that we tighten up when we experience pain.

If I hurt something the muscles around that part tighten up. And then it prevents me from getting further hurt.

This happens to me all the time.

## A personal story

One time, I injured my shoulder on the trampoline. I think I’ve always been watching out for my shoulders since then. I was jumping around doing backflips (I had no fear) and then I fell off the side and dislocated my left shoulder.

Partially dislocated rotator cuff. Ever since then, I haven’t really had the same confidence I had, and it would pop out every so often

I nursed it a lot, when I played basketball, I never really let myself be pushed. I would wear a lot of braces too.

Now, I do handstands and it’s not really a problem.

So when I look at my own injury now. The tingling pain I feel on my right side, I think it’s a little bit like that. It comes back every so often.

Some movement program might help me feel a bit better. But stress management is a big part of it also.

I can tell that when I’m stressed it will flare up.

## Applying it

Can I help people observe, and learn.
