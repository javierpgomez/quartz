# The top idea in your mind
By Paul Graham 

You know that feeling when you're working on a problem
then can't get it
then you do something else
and it just comes to you

That's what Paul Graham calls the idea in the top of your mind
It's what your brain will work on subconsciously.

So you have to put the right problem on the top of your mind

In fitness
We have burst of eagerness and focus
Then it stops becoming interesting

Use that burst
Not to work out more
But to lay the foundation for habits
