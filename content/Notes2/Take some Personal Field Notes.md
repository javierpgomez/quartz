Keep your field journal with you (that’s why a note on your phone works great). Write the time and a couple of sentences whenever you take a break, switch tasks, or notice something interesting. That “something interesting” could be external such as an event, or internal such as a feeling – maybe uneasiness or excitement. If something made you stop for a second to wonder whether you should write it down, then it’s interesting enough.

It's a tricky practice, but very valuable to do.
