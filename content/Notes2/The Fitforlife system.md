### Context / Source


### Key Idea

The FFLOS (Fitforlife OS) states that it's not the tools or the workout that will help you make changes.

It's the self-awareness = i.e. the meta thinking
and understanding how to hack your behavior

But not every system will just work
It's not plug and play

You should be 

-   **_Customization:_** Easy to tweak based on your personality, industry and tendencies.
-   **_Combinatorial:_** Multiple systems can be combined to suit your own complex needs.
-   **_Internalization:_** With time, the behaviors become internalized as habits.
-   **_Scaleability:_** As an end state, you find your maximum point of leverage.

I can take this idea and make it compeletely specific to fitness kasi
