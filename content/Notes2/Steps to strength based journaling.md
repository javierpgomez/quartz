### Key Idea

There is no pressure to answer every prompt in one sitting. Research suggests that writing about your positive experiences three times weekly for just 15 minutes leads to improved well-being, decreased anxiety, and more resilience. In short, apply these three easy steps to start applying strength-based journaling: 

1. Craft a curated list of strength-based journaling prompts to choose from. 
2. 
3. 2. Block recurring sessions in your calendar, which can combine strength-based journaling with other self-reflection exercises, such as your weekly review. 
4. 
5. 3. Write down your answers for as little as 15 minutes.
