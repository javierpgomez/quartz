Q:
What are you doing now?

It's because I'm targeting more specifically people who are stuck in injury and want to build mental fitness to trust their body again

What was your situation?

If you remember, where did you go? Who did you see and talk to?

After the physical therapy process, how was it then? What was your next step?

Did you feel confident? What changed about your movement or the way you felt about your body?

What are your trigger points now?

What do you do when you have the back pain now?
