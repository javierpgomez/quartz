# The Semmelweis Reflex (concept)

## Source
- I think it was Cautionary Tales

## Key Idea

### Story
- Ignaz Semmelweiss was a Hungarian physician
- He discovered in 1847 that hospital mortality fell when doctors disinfected their hands with a chlorine solution
- His ideas were rejected  because of non-scientific resistance and things that had to do more with ego
- "gentleman's hands cannot transmit disease"
