### Key Idea

So how do you learn to not brace all the time? It starts with awareness. Pay attention to when you're bracing. Notice when your body tenses up and your breath quickens. And then ask yourself if there's really anything to be afraid of.

It's not always easy to let go and trust your subconscious, but it's necessary if you want to be reactive and adaptive. When you're able to do that, you'll find that you're able to move through life with more ease and grace. Things will flow more naturally, and you'll be open to new experiences.
