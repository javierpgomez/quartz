# It's not philosophy

For Dante, 
We don't get to paradise by becoming good moral philosophers
(Though everyone in heaven is kind of a doctor of the church)

But it comes from experiencing things.
Acting according to our beliefs.

So it's that idea that it's something you have to experience in your body

## Key insight

Dante's key insight 
Is that you can't think your way through
You have to experience your way through 

This is what it means to suffer
to experience
Passio- to undergo
to experience

## In the body

I remember this idea that you have a body
thus your suffering is more valuable.
You can do more.
It is worth more

## Purgatorio

Whereas since in the purgatory
They are all shades
They cannot suffer in the same kind of way
The suffering of the body
Transforms you faster
than thinking and in the mind

## The body is the vessel for transformation

[[Notes/James clear's steps to change]]
How you have to deal with your body

You can't just "think" your way into transformation
You have to experience your way into transformation

## Pass through the body

If you want to change your identity
Pass through your body
The body is the vessel

Bring the body and the mind will follow
[[Twelve Steps Concept of Bring the Body]]

Fake your way into a new way of being
If you can act it, you will eventually become it

[[Aristotle and Virtue Ethics]]
By acting, it affects the kind of person that you become.

## Dante knew this

Whether it's Dante or James Clear
or Aristotle

This idea is timeless and it works across all sorts of genres
You can't read your way through
and you can't think your way through

You just have to do it. 
Experience it

One step at a time!

## With a Virgil

With a guide
Someone you look up to
Someone who you idolize
Someone whose work you do

And you'll be able to surpass your mentor
that's the point

The mentor vanishes
and you can ascend

The coach vaults you up
and the coach steps back and disappears
Just like Virgil
