### Interview Questions

What groups do you usually work with?

What kind of work do they do?

How do they find out about our clinic/office?
(referral? walk in? Online?)

Where do your clients hang out?

I'm interested in working with clients who get stuck and aren't able to move on. Like they keep coming back to physical therapy (maybe even if it's not necessary anymore)

Is that something that happens in the groups you work with?

Do you feel like there are any signs that someone is going to become that kind of patient?

What happens when clients don't want to move on?
