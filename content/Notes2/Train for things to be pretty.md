### Key Idea

When it comes to working out, there's no need to max out. You don't need to put all of your effort into every movement. You can focus on making your movements pretty.

Training for things to be pretty can help you stay motivated. If you're constantly pushing yourself to the limit, you're more likely to get burnt out. But if you're working out for the sake of making your movements look good, you'll be more likely to stick with it.

Plus, there are benefits to training for aesthetics. It can help you improve your posture and increase your flexibility. And who doesn't want to look good?

So next time you're in the gym, don't worry about maxing out. Just focus on making your movements pretty.
