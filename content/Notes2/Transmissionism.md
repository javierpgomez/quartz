# Transmissionism

t’s the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another. If only! The idea is so thoroughly discredited that “transmissionism” is only used pejoratively, in reference to naive historical teaching practices. Or as an ad-hominem in juicy academic spats.

It's the medium that teaches you
(including the content)
The content is like what to think
But the medium teaches you how to think
