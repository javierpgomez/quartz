# Having a good map is important (Story)

## Story Analogy

Story of travelling in Taiwan.
Some like bus
Some like train

## Idea

Because then you take the way that works best for you

Don't say you HAVE to take the bus

Or sometimes the bus is the best way
sometimes walking is the best way

or the experience of each one is different

But a good map is essential
I am a map nerd

Building a fitness map

[[Notes/The map is not the territory]]
