### Key Idea

Which they did because food and fuel are through the roof because the Sri Lankan rupee has plummeted because the government is defaulting because it doesn’t have enough foreign currency because the country’s exports have dropped because the government had the good idea of making the entire country grow organic food only by banning the import of fertilizers and herbicides overnight, which dropped yields and exports.
