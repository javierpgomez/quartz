### Context / Source
[[Notes/Atomic Lessons with Dustin Bakkie]]

### Key Idea

If you have clear outcomes when you teach- this lets you see the achievement rate of your students

So make your outcome something very concrete- like
- Send me a video where
- Send me an email where (this is what [[Alexander Mullan]] does)

That way I can identify an achievement rate, which is the answer to the question:
- What percentage of people were able to do the thing that I ask them to do
