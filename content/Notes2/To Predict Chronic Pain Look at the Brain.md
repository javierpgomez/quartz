# To Predict Chronic Pain Look at the Brain

## Context
Many people experience a lot of chronic pain.
It's frustrating because it's invisible pain too

## Some facts

Pain rarely correlates with MRI or posture

Most people get over acute pain after a few days.
Some people can develop chronic pain

## some quotes

"Taken together, these ideas can be simplified as **a lowered mesolimbic threshold for the conscious perception of pain**, which functionally renders the brain addicted to pain. (Baliki 2015)"

"It is therefore not surprising that these conditions are often comorbid, and indeed, **there is now a small but emerging literature regarding the interaction between negative moods and acute and chronic pain**. (Baliki 2015).""
