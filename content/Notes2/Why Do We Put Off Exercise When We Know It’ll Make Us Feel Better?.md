Usually, when I'm sitting still for too long, I start to become more and more antsy. It feels like I'm just stewing in my own brain. 

And even though I KNOW that moving, walking, running, going to the gym, makes me feel better.  It's still such a hard thing to do! I simply do everything else before going to the gym. Completely INSANE.

The truth is "Javier just needs to go for a walk." And everytime I do I feel so much better.

It reminds me of the important of [Focusing on Meaningful Movement](Notes/Focusing%20on%20Meaningful%20Movement.md) and finding what kind of movement works for you. Because doing any kind of movement is amazing for our bodies, and it helps us really get in a good flow.
