### Key Idea

Exclusivity is to Venture Capital as apple pie is to Americaâ€”in its very heart, blood, and soul. I do not consider this a good thing. Nor do my new teammates at Stonks. We consider exclusivity antithetical to innovation and technological progress. More, we believe that diversity of both thought and experience drives the leaping emergent effects that change things for the better. Because of this, we are working to spearhead the mass adoption of quality startup investing by making it approachable, inclusive, and simple.
