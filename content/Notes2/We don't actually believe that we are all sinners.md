# We don't actually believe that we are all sinners

Unlike the twelve step program. 
Where they are undeniably alcoholics 

## it's one of the hardest things to admit

But at least people who have physical addictions
Have an easy sense of when they are addicted or not
because they feel it in their body.
They can be completely aware of when they have addictions
or when they're dry

But people addicted to other things
power, anger pride, etc
These things are harder to see
Because there is no clear physical manifestation
Sobriety looks very different for those individuals
It's not clear when you're acting out or when you're sober
