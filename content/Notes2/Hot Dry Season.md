# Hot-Dry Season

## Context

I'm trying to grow stuff in the summer, and it's too hot!

## What is it?

Around March, that's when there's a shift from cool-dry to hot-dry. PAGASA notes that when the wind shifts from northeasterly to easterly, that's when the monsoon ends.

You can think of our climate as having two seasons-- the rainy and the dry. The rainy is from June to November. The dry actually can be divided into two seasons pala. There's a cool dry from December to February, then there's a hot dry from March to May.

The Northeast Monsoon is also called the AMIHAN. This is cold winds from the northeast that brings rain over the eastern side. The Southwest Monsoon naman is the HABAGAY is the warm moist winds from the southwest. This one affects Laguna (and the western parts of the Philippines)

## Some observations
I'm noticing a lot things are coming to life in June
as the rainy season is about to start
so it does feel like this is where things start to come alive.

## Why is it important?

I guess this is kinda obvious.
But to me it was not.
I've had to learn this through experience.

It's important though because it affects what I can grow and when I can grow them.
