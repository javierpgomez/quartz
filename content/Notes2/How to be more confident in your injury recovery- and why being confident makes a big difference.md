# How to be more confident in your recovery

The biggest misconception with injury is that your body failed you.

The truth is that it's not your body, it's the mind.

There are so many people who go through injury, they hurt themselves in their sports. So they see doctors, and they see physical therapists. And then they get stuck because they can't get past the injury- they're stuck in the lack of confidence.

They're stuck with these thoughts.

What if I'm not 100%?

What if I'm the exception and my body didn't recover full?

What if I'll never move well again?

If you're thinking these thoughts, you're not giving your body a chance to heal. You're not giving yourself a chance to get better.

These thoughts become a self fulfilling prophecy!

## The solution that you need is to build up confidence in your body and recovery after injury

### Here are some tips to continue your recovery and build up confidence after injury

1.  **Avoid the Google searching**
    

This is a tricky one because we feel like we need more information to get better. But there's a paradox with doing our own research- it's because there's so much information out there that it makes you feel less confident instead of more confident.

How many times have you tried searching on Google for the right thing to do but end up feeling more overwhelmed and confused with what the right thing to do is?

Information overload is a real thing, and it keeps people stuck

2.  **Seek out a support group**
    

When it comes to building confidence after injury, try seeking out a support group.There are often groups available for people recovering from injury. This can be a great way to meet others in similar situations and to gain support and motivation.

Injury can be a very isolating experience. It can be difficult to adjust to a new lifestyle and to cope with the physical and emotional challenges that come with it. A support group can provide a much-needed sense of community and can be a great source of advice and support.

If you're not sure where to start, ask your doctor or rehabilitation team if they know of any support groups in your area. You can also search online for groups that focus on specific injuries or conditions.

3.  **Find a coach or trainer who focuses on mindset**
    

Many times, working with a coach or trainer can help increase your confidence. They can help you set appropriate goals and give you the guidance and support you need to reach those goals.

This is something that is overlooked, because we see injury just as a physical issue. But if you're struggling with confidence, you will benefit more from seeing a counselor or mindset coach who can help you work though negative thoughts and feelings.

4.  **Get back to your sport or activity-**
    

When you're injured, it's easy to lose confidence. You may feel like you're not good enough, or like you'll never be able to do what you used to do.

But it's important to remember that you can get better. And one of the best ways to do that is to get back to the sport or activity that you love as soon as you can. This is often the hardest step, but it's also the most important. Getting back to the activity or sport that you love will help you to remember why you're doing all of this in the first place. It will also help your body to continue to heal and to get stronger.

Of course, you'll need to be careful. Don't push yourself too hard, and listen to your body. But if you can, getting back to the sport or activity that you love will help you on the road to recovery.

5.  **Celebrate the wins, no matter how small**
    

I was in a car accident a few years ago that left me with some serious injuries. I was in a lot of pain and had to miss a lot of work. I was also really afraid that I would never be able to do the things I used to be able to do.I had to start my rehabilitation from scratch and it was a long and difficult journey. But, I am happy to say that I am now back to my old self and I am even better than before.

One of the things that helped me the most during my rehabilitation was celebrating the wins, no matter how small. Every time I was able to do something that I thought I wouldn't be able to do, I would take a moment to celebrate.

It sounds like a small thing, but it made a big difference for me. It helped me to stay positive and motivated, and it also helped me to feel like I was making progress.

If you are currently injured, or if you have recently been injured, I encourage you to try celebrating the wins, no matter how small. It might just make a big difference for you too.

## Your mind is the number 1 killer of injury recovery.

If you want to recover, you have to change your mindset. You have to start thinking positively. You have to start believing in yourself.

It's not easy, but it's so worth it.
