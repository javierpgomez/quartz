# Teaching people to use networked thinking

We have this sneaking suspicion that things are connected.
We see how areas in our lives are connected
Principles apply across areas.

Mindmap is top down

You have to create a situation.
Where you can stumble upon your old ideas

## Serendipity
[[Notes/A quote from Designing your life]]

Always creative

## For fitness

Serendipitious activity
Providing chances to discover new things?
Hard!

Serendipitious logging
Providing chances to learn things.
Or to see old ideas.

## Readwise as an example

I think that's what readwise is doing. You see your old highlights and that jogs ideas and memories to you.

## For TOK

I think there's a world where I teach IB students how to take notes and make their papers or whatever
