# Masterly Inactivity in the Garden

Since we were in Bataan for a month, I had to accept that my plants would probably not make it. No one would be around to water and take care of them all. Oh well, let it go. It would be a chance to reset and start afresh.

When we got back, there were a lot of weeds that had grown-- as expected. But I was surprised to see that some plants made it through the month without me. The onions were still there. The kamote had continued to grow. Even some dragonfruit that a friend gave survived.

I've heard somewhere that most plants actually die from overcare or overwater. It's easy for me to get precious about each and every plant that I'm taking care of- trying to make sure that each one gets the best chance of surviving. 

But I'm slowly learning that plants die. It's okay. Not all of them will do well. And the best thing I can do for them is to give them great conditions-- nice soil, enough nutrients, and then step back and let nature take care of itself.

I'd like to practice this more. Knowing when to sit back and do nothing, and when to intervene before things become serious.

I think it will work for us in the long run better. I'm happy with a great (or even good) harvest with very little effort, over an absolutely perfect harvest, but having to meticulously watch my plants every single minute of the day.
