Should you watch that movie / play that game / read that book? The formula is:

[# who rated it 5/5] + [# who rated it 1/5] – [# who rated it 3/5].

This doesn’t [apply to everything](https://putanumonit.com/2016/02/03/015-dating_1/), but it applies to many things, including media. There are too many options out there to waste time on mediocrity, and everything great will be divisive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hch4tfkxzhh6xdd98sztqta1))

**Note:** Do it for exercise too? Either you're super passionate or you don't bother

If you don't love the exercise, then there's no point really. Otherwise, you're not going to do it.
