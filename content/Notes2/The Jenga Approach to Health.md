### Key Ideas

He calls it the “Jenga” theory, where each impact factor is like taking a brick out of a Jenga tower, until eventually so many bricks have been removed that the tower falls down. 

While many people and doctors will only focus on the last brick that was removed as being the root cause of symptoms, it is the entire history and the combination of all the every brick that led to tower falling

I love this idea because it captures the idea that health is complex
And it's not just one thing

And it's easy to focus on the last block.
But there's a lot of factors

That's interesting because I think a lot about healthcare misses so much of the story
That why I had this thought of [[Notes/Fitness coaches should be part of the healthcare system]]

That reminds me why food matters too [[Notes/Food is your best medicine by Eugene Schwartz]]
It's similar because you have to address all these factors if you're going to have an effective health routine

It's different because, don't forget that the healthcare system is still important! No matter how much it costs.

It's important because we need to be able to balance those two things together
