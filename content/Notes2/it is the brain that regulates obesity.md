### Key Idea

The brain actually regulates body fatness
So you can pinpoint the brain
when it comes to regulating weight

It's the hypothalamus

of any kind relates to body fatness, how much we eat, how we use our bodies, how we sleep, whether we're stressed or not, we think any of that relates to body fatness, then we think the brain is playing a role. I think most people would agree that food intake quantity and quality is pretty important there. The second reason is that the brain actually contains a regulatory system for body fat for body fatness I should say body fat mass. And it's the only known system in the body that does that. And it's located primarily in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which is forget who described it this way. Maybe it was Herman paan, sir. It's like a lot of bubblegum on the bottom of your brain near
