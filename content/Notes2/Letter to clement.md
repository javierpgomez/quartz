# Letter to Clement (in the divine office)

to the Corinthians
This was the bit about how they were getting chastized
in the same way that Paul was chastizing them

So it's a story about humans being the same
And not getting frustrated

But asking yourself
Will I break the cycle?

It's just so funny to me
