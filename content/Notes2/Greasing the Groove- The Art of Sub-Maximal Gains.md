In the fitness world, the doctrine of progressive overload reigns supreme. The idea is to continually increase the amount of weight or resistance to stimulate muscle growth or strength gains. But what if we flip the script? Enter "Greasing the Groove," a strategy that focuses on volume through sub-maximal sets.

The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and adaptability. Instead of pushing for the hardest possible reps each time, you focus on quality reps that are less taxing. This allows for more sets and, consequently, a higher total volume of work. It's akin to a writer focusing on writing 200 good words every day rather than aiming for a perfect essay in one sitting. Over time, those 200 words add up to a substantial body of work.

For someone like me, who finds most exercise routines boring, this approach can be a game-changer. It allows for more frequent engagement with the activity, making it easier to integrate into daily life. It's not about the grand gestures of lifting the heaviest weight; it's about the consistent, smaller actions that accumulate into significant results.

However, it's crucial to remember that "Greasing the Groove" is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. It's a tool in the toolbox, useful for specific goals like increasing pull-up numbers or improving technique. It's not necessarily the go-to for hypertrophy or maximal strength gains.
