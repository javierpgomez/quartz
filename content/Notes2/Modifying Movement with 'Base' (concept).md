# Modifying Movement with 'Base' (concept)

Source:
[[Notes/GMB Workshop- Modfiying Movement for Strength Flexibility or Control]]

- Use the idea of 'points of contact' to establish what your base is
- A good base means something is more stable
	- and thus probably easier

## Some interesting questions
- Can you break down a foot into more than one point of contact?
	- Like if you can become aware of your foot in a way that it's not just a foot, but the front and back of the foot.
