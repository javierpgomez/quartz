# Want to explore movement and have fun again? Look at how the kids do it

When have you ever seen a child under the age of 10 pull or strain a muscle? Even if you give them something too heavy for them to pick up, they will try a few different methods and walk away without being hurt. Just like birds who are born instinctively knowing how to fly, children instinctively know how to move.

We can learn a lot by copying how children move! Plus it's a lot of fun to rediscover some of these movements again in our adult lives.

Children are constantly exploring their environment and trying new things. They are not afraid of falling, because they know they will get back up again. And they move with a joy and exuberance that is hard to find in adults.

When was the last time you moved your body just for the sake of moving? When was the last time you played?

We can all benefit from incorporating more movement and play into our lives. It doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. Just a few minutes a day of moving our bodies in new and interesting ways can reinvigorate your routine and your movements!

Here's some fun movements that kids do all the time for you to try

### Crawling

One great example of this is crawling. 

Children are always moving on the ground, on the hands and knees. For us adults, most of the time we're on our feet (or sitting on our butt). Try crawling again and see what it feels like. 

You might be surprised at how good it feels to move your body in new ways. It can help increase your flexibility, balance, and coordination. And it's a great way to relieve stress. 

So next time you're feeling stagnant in your movement, or like you need a break from the everyday grind, consider crawling around for a few minutes. It's a great way to get your body moving and have some fun too!

### Rolling

One great example of this is rolling around. Like crawling, it's another way that we can spend time on the floor and learn from being there. This one can be challenging, so go slow and do what makes you feel safe. Start by lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Place your arms at your sides. Slowly begin to roll your body to the right, using your lower back and glutes to control the movement. Return to the starting position and repeat on the left side. Continue alternating sides for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If this is too difficult, you can modify the move by keeping your knees bent and placing your hands on the floor beside you for support. Or, try placing a yoga block or pillow under your hips for additional support. Rolling is a great way to release tension in the spine and open up the chest and shoulders. It's also a wonderful way to massage the internal organs and stimulate the lymphatic system. Give it a try and see how you feel!

### Crab walks

Crab walking is a great way to move your body in a new and interesting way. It's also a great way to get a little bit of exercise in, as well as to have some fun.Crab walking is a movement that is often used in physical therapy, as it is a low-impact way to move the body and to get some exercise in. It is also a great way to improve balance and coordination. To do a crab walk, you will need to get down on all fours. You can either start in a standing position or a sitting position. If you start in a standing position, you will want to place your hands on your hips. If you start in a sitting position, you will want to place your hands on the ground in front of you. Once you are in position, you will want to slowly start to move your legs and arms. You will want to move them in a crab-like motion, moving them back and forth. You can also move your head from side to side if you want to. As you are crab walking, you will want to keep your back straight and your head up. You will also want to keep your core engaged so that you are stable. Once you have gotten the hang of crab walking, you can start to move faster and add in some turns. You can also add in some arm movements. Crab walking is a great way to get your body moving and to have some fun. It is also a great way to get some exercise in. Try it today!

### Hopping and skipping

One great example of this is hopping around and skipping. We never do this as adults! But kids are doing this all the time. It's perfect for coordination. And it gives your muscles a little burst. Plus, it's just plain fun! So next time you're feeling stuck in a rut, take a cue from the kids and hop to it!

## It's about exploration, not perfection

When it comes to exploring and learning about their bodies, kids don't strive for perfection or efficiency. Instead, they're focused on understanding how things feel and what they can learn from the experience.

This mindset can be beneficial in many areas of life, not just when it comes to learning about the body. By taking the time to explore and understand how things feel, we can gain a greater understanding of the world around us and our place in it.

When it comes to the body, this exploration can help you learn about the different sensations you feel and what you mean. It can also help them understand how their bodies work and how to take care of them.

By encouraging to explore and be aware of their bodies, we can help them develop a healthy relationship with their bodies and a better understanding of themselves.

Start exploring, stop seeking perfection and optimization.
