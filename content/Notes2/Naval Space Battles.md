# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

I like the idea in this essay that space battles will be more like navigating the sea instead of flying

So it's not open space like in whatever show
It's a bit like star wars actually.
Where you have to spend time near planets.
Use them as islands
And then fight in the periphery of it

So you have islands.
Like during the pacific war
