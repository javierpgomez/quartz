The key is to be data-informed, not data-driven. If data is beneficial in many cases, it would be a mistake to believe it should drive everything.

I think about this paradox very often:

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." — Goodhart's law

"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it." — Drucker's maxim
