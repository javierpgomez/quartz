### Key Idea

Do you always burn out whenever you try new habits, diets, and exercises? Maybe you're trying to be 'too perfect' in the process.

That's normal, we all want to succeed.

One way you can help yourself is by aiming for 80% instead of 100% consistency. It's more forgiving. It allows for life to happen. Some days you really are just too busy to follow through.

80% gives you the space to stick to it for the long term
