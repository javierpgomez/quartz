Much like a compelling blog template or a code snippet that saves countless hours of work, the concept of "copy and paste" isn't just relegated to the world of tech. It can be a powerful tool in mastering new skills or lifestyle changes. If it worked for Kassie in adopting a vegetarian lifestyle, who's to say it can't be a part of our arsenal in making lasting changes?

In the health and fitness coaching landscape where I navigate, the instinct is often to tailor everything to the individual, to make it "unique." But let's be honest: reinventing the wheel every time isn't just tedious—it's often unnecessary. The balance between customization and efficiency is like that of an athlete knowing when to push and when to rest. The "copy and paste" strategy offers a useful blueprint to springboard off of.

This approach fits snugly with the principle of "standing on the shoulders of giants." Why slog through the swamp of trial and error when there are proven paths you can follow? As in, if a vegetarian lifestyle is achieved successfully with particular meal strategies, one can replicate that method without a second thought.

I believe that we could weave this strategy into the coaching practice seamlessly. There's a sort of elegance in finding what works, cloning it, and then tweaking it to fit one's needs. After all, isn't that what successful businesses, great athletes, and even ecosystems do? They adapt based on existing successful models. It's a lesson in humility, acknowledging that others might have cracked a code you're trying to decipher.

So, my respect for the "copy and paste" strategy grows. It's not about abandoning innovation but recognizing that innovation often comes from iteration, not ideation. Why not give our clients—and ourselves—the best possible starting point?
