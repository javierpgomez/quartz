# The middle ground between Wikipedia and individual blogs

## Source:
- My own experience writing and teaching

## Key Idea
- I was just thinking about how when you look up knowledge
- You go to google, and you search something
- Or you go to wikipedia and look something up.
- It's great and its big. it's linked to the credibility of the site

- At the other end of the spectrum is the individual's blog post.
- Where you have single experts you trust

- There needs to be more middle ideas
- Collections of people, groups whose knowledge you like
- Like what if Ateneo wrote a wiki; or what if UP did
- Yes that information is out there.
- But it's not curated well
