# Idea Name

### Context / Source


### Key Idea

2 ways I find wearable data really valuable right now:

1⃣ Triggering deeper conversations or reflections
 
When values are outside your normal range, ask why - interrogate your context 

2⃣ Building self-awareness

When a metric is low, ask 'how do I feel?' & look for patterns
