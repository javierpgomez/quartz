### Key Idea

If you try to hack reputation
It will come back to you

Think Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos

In fact, everybody who tries to hack a reputation is penalized badly by the society and they get corrected quickly, but slow repetition usually gives you more currency to outlast. And I think uh, when it comes to decision making, like thinking about what is the slow currency of life reputation, wealth, All of that. Like don't try to hack it. Anybody who's trying to hack it will always lose it quickly because uh, they will not have the muscle to retain it. For example, a lot of people who get rich 

And even if you get it,
Because you didn't do it
You won't have the muscle to sustain it
