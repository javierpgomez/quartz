# The Curse of Knowledge

from C.S. Lewis
We learn best from the people who are just one step in front of us

So it's not that we learn from the experts
Because they don't remember what it was like to be amateurs

We learn best from people who are just one bit ahead of us
That's the best part about this experience

As long as don't people don't think they're so smart
i.e. don't mistake your rate of improvement for your competence
[[Think again]]
