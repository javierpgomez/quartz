Most traditions exist for a reason

Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. 

Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. 

The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology

That's interesting because we have to trust that traditions are good and for our best interest.

Because it would be possible for traditions to crop up in order to defend something harmful, painful or unethical.

That reminds me of [[Chesterton's Fence]] and [[Notes/It is hard to explain why traditions exist]]

It's important because knowing these principles can help you choose when to follow or when to reject the principles.
