# Learning by Copying (Concept)

## Story

Miles Davis said
It took me years to learn to play like myself
But first he was copying the people that he liked.
His idols

This quote I heard from David Chapelle

There's also a book called the "Secret to our Sucess"
The idea is that what makes human so advantageous
is that we can copy one another
(I think other animals can do this too naman)
But we really take it up to the next level

(I think Dawkins calls this a "meme")

It's that we can copy one another.
It's something that gets passed on just by seeing
(not genetically)
or biologically

This reminds me of the Blind Guy chronicles
and how he talks about the fact that he cannot make facial expressions
But he did not get the chance to visually copy the expressions that people make.

## Who are my fitness idols

So one of the tricks here.
Is to find good models to copy.

In mindset
GMB and PN has really resonated with me.
I like the messaging of GMB that focuses on principles and on autonomy
I like the messaging of PN that talks about deep health

In business.
I like David Perell's stuff
I like that it's about writing.
Or more accurately, I like that it's about sharing ideas.

In movement
Find people who's movements I like
I like watching Ryan move
(though it's so far beyond anything I can do)
I like watchin pro athletes move.
Just getting that movement deep into my body
By watching.
Not really breaking down and not really overthinking things

## Copy don't think

There's two ways of copying someone.

You can analyze. Break it down into bits and pieces and step by step processed
Theory and math
Calculation.
Trying to figure out how they do it.

In business, studying their strategy
In movement, understanding the form
In writing, seeing the structure
In chess, analyzing the position.
(These are all valuable and necessary)
(Sometimes easier though and can be a crutch)

[[In Chess, overanalysis can be a crutch - Engines and Analysis paralysis]]

The second way is to just try it.
Do it yourself.
Get on the floor and move.
Build your business (fail and learn)
In writing, just write
In chess just play.

This way, you try to copy and you see the gaps.
Then you learn how to fill it in.

[[Ira Glass on taste and talent and creativity]]
You have the taste.
You know what good movement looks like
You know what good chess looks like.
You just can't match that yet with what you're capable of.

And there's no way around it but to practice.

## Express myself

As you copy. 
You'll find that slowly, you suddenly become able to express yourself more.
To manifest your own unique style

Because as you try to close the gap,
Between what your taste likes
and what you're capable of
You discover that it becomes this third thing
Which is you
Your own unique epxression

With movement
I try to move like Ryan
And I find I cannot
But my own body lets me move in a way that is uniquely my own
and I express that

and with writing.
To harness my ideas
I try to write like David
but I cannot
and in trying I learn to write like me.
