# Scott Fitzgerald Quote

Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to **hold** two **opposing ideas** in **mind** at the same time and still **retain** the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless yet be determined to make them otherwise.”
