- Hard to pin down. It feels like a GMB concept

## Key ideas
- What is graceful?
	- it's when a movement looks effortless, even though it's incredibly hard
- We know it when we see it

	- Seeing people run
	- Or watch basketball, and seeing the athleticism
	- Gymanstics and ballet also
- When we see good physical ability, something in you just knows it's good
