Why are we so self critical?

I actually wrote about this in a newsletter [Becoming Fitforlife #35]

Our inner voices can be incredible problem-solvers or harsh critics. 

To make our inner voices less cruel, we need to cultivate our self-compassion. There is actually a useful test that you can take to see how well you are doing in this regard
[Take the Self-Compassion Test](https://self-compassion.org/self-compassion-test/)

Practices such as distanced self-talk can help us place our challenges in the larger context of the human experience.
