When embarking on the entrepreneurial journey, it's common to adopt a CFO mindset, meticulously ensuring that expenses are below income. While this approach is rational from a financial standpoint, it can sometimes overshadow the emotional and psychological gains of choosing an unconventional path. The excitement and potential of the new journey often make the financial stress worth enduring.

The concept of "leaning out," as seen in alternative educational paths like homeschooling, can also apply to entrepreneurship. It's about embracing an unconventional path that aligns with your philosophy, even if it comes with its own set of challenges and stresses.

Financial stress in entrepreneurship is a paradox. On one hand, it's a constant reminder of the risks involved; on the other, it's a testament to the courage it takes to follow an unconventional path. The key is to manage this stress not as a deterrent but as a complex variable in the equation of your life's work.

Remember, stress isn't inherently bad; it's about finding the right dose that challenges you but doesn't break you. Just like in physical training, the body and mind need to be stressed to grow, but not to the point of harm.
