### Key Ideas

The key idea here is that Dr Alia Krum did a study where she taught people about the movements they were getting throughout the day and how it was actually the right amount as recommended.

That's interesting because it talks about how mindset is a huge factor in your health

That reminds me of how [[Notes/Pain Education]] is important for being healthy
It's similar because when it comes to pain, knowledge is a big factor here too!
It's different because pain isn't exactly the same as weight loss
It's important because people still believe that bodies are more like machines and not so much a full mind-body connection
