It's impossible to play without risking injury.

The important thing is to figure out ways to fail safely.

I tweeted about this here: [Javier Luis Gomez üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è on X: "One of the key features of play is that it involves (controlled) risk Remember when you were a kid and you would explore? Learning to run meant you fight tumble and fall Try and bring a bit of that back into your practice" / X](https://twitter.com/javiiegomez/status/1489815268415389705)
