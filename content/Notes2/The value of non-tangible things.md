### Key Idea

-In terms of the effect on happiness, having a friend you see regularly is worth $100,000 a year -Being married is also worth $100,000 -Seeing your neighbor regularly is worth $60,000 -Other research suggests that income doesnâ€™t have a lasting increase on happiness because people usually adapt to money. In contrast, marriage, family, and health have lasting increases on happiness and are immune to hedonic adaptation.
