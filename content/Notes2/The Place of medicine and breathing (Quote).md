## The Quote
"Modern medicine, they said, was amazingly efficient at cutting out and stitching up parts of the body in emergencies, but sadly deficient at treating milder, chronic systemic maladies- the asthma, headaches, stress, and autoimmune issues that most of the modern population contends with.""

## Key Idea
- There needs to be balance
- I'd like to hit the gaps in that.
	- (Not smart)
	- Don't pit yourself against doctors
- I would like to work on those milder, chornic systemic maladies.
	- Aches and pains
	- Breathing
	- Stress
	- Etc.
