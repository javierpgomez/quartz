## Key Idea:
- This is Pareto principle applied to minorities
- It is not the minority that bends to the majority
- But an inflexible minority that forces the majority to acquiesce to them
	- For example, automatic drivers force manual cars out
	- (They were once a minority)


## Highlights
- We might assume that the nature of democracy would mean the minority acquiesces to the whims of the majority. In reality, the majority’s passivity toward a policy or behavior is surpassed only by the minority’s rigidity toward it.
