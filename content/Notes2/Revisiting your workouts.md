# Revisiting your workouts

## Analogy

- I reread LOTR
- I reread Dante
- I rewatch LOTR

- It's a different experience each time
- These are things where I like the journey not the destination

- For example, I would walk the camino again.
- Because it's not an experience to consume, but one to journey through

## Key Idea
- Are there workouts or programs where you enjoy the journey?
- Don't think of workouts as one and dones
- Can you revisit it in a fun way?
