We often think that asking for favors burdens others, but the real burden is on us when we don't ask. It's like a self-imposed exile from the collective wisdom and support that could be available to us. This isn't just a theory; it's a lived experience. I've found that not asking for help can actually stifle relationships and opportunities.

Consider the example of not following up with someone because you think you've already taken up enough of their time. This is a classic case of projecting our own assumptions onto others. We think we're being respectful, but we're actually cutting off a potentially enriching interaction.

Here's a counterintuitive question to ponder: What's the worst that could happen if you ask for a favor or follow up? The answer often reveals that the risk is minimal compared to the potential reward.

This is a game-changer for me. It's a reminder to get out of my own head and engage with others. Because the truth is, we don't know what others are thinking unless we ask. And when we do, we might just find that our perceived liabilities are actually assets.
