### Key Idea

The freedom to exit is the idea that the founder can get out when they want to . It's not linked to the founder

In my case, how would I get out of fitforlife and keep it going even when I'm done?

How will GMB do it?

How did religions do it?

Small things being centralized is great, extremely large things being centralized is terrifying. And given the reality of network effects, the freedom to exit again is not sufficient ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522307276/20088766))

Maybe things should just be allowed to die
