This is very similar to [Concepts MOC](Maps/Concepts%20MOC.md), but this space is more devoted to anecdotes, analogies, and frameworks.

For example, in all areas of life you should aim to [Develop a Plug and Play System to 10x Results](Notes/Develop%20a%20Plug%20and%20Play%20System%20to%2010x%20Results.md) and to [Work on the Invisible Things](Notes/Work%20on%20the%20Invisible%20Things.md)

A very concrete example of that is [My favorite 'hack' when I'm hiking and traveling](Notes/My%20favorite%20'hack'%20when%20I'm%20hiking%20and%20traveling.md)

Go one level up: [[]]

The space below is for my own use:

### Notes to Process
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[]]
and !outgoing([[]])
sort file.mtime desc
```
