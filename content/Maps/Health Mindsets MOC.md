Getting healthy is so much more than just finding a good exercise or workout that you can do.

80% of the game is learning how to think about your health, and overcome some thinking traps.

For example, the most common thing that I notice is that people always have [The too late feeling](Notes/The%20too%20late%20feeling.md). It's almost as if we believe that health is only for young people who are strong and agile.

But the truth is that it's possible to be active well into our elderly years. One can experience [Aging into Athleticism](Notes/Aging%20into%20Athleticism.md) and at the end of the day [Play is a state of Mind](Notes/Play%20is%20a%20state%20of%20Mind.md)

And even when one gets hurt, it's possible to experience [Post Traumatic Growth](Notes/Post%20Traumatic%20Growth.md). So there are so many possibilities for health
