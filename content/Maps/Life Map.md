# Life Map ðŸ—º
I'm amazed at how many people don't zoom out and consider how to live a good life.

## Compass ðŸ§­
These are the dials that determine where I go.

- My Direction & Drivers
	- 01 - [[My Roles]] | [[My Permissions]]
	- 02 - [[My Environments]] | [[My Tools]]
	- 03 - [[My Experiences]] |  [[Life Reflections]]
	- 04 - [[My Virtues]] | [[My Skills]] | [[My Spark List]]
	- 05 - [[My Manifesto]] | [[My Goals]]
	- 06 - [[Notes/My Obituary]]

[[Notes/The idea of Tetris-ing experiences (it has to be done in the right order)]]

See those numbers above. They don't have to be there. I had a version of this note with them removed. But I like them in this map. For your own life map, do what works best for you!

Off in the distance is my [[Cabin]].

### Some MOCs with no sorting yet
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[Life Map]]
and !outgoing([[Life Map]])
sort file.mtime desc
```

### Unmentioned notes, with related tag
These notes have the tag `#` and are not mentioned above.

```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from #life
and !outgoing([[Life Map]])
sort file.mtime desc
```
