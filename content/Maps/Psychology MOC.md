As I strive to be a better health coach, there's so much psychology involved in the process! 

Right now I rely mostly on my [Philosophy MOC](Maps/Philosophy%20MOC.md) and [Spirituality MOC](Maps/Spirituality%20MOC.md) background, but there is so much to learn and explore.

A handy place to start is with this [Research on so-called "Positive Intelligence"](Notes/Research%20on%20so-called%20"Positive%20Intelligence".md)

I've also written and made videos about some ideas here:
- [How we self sabotage](Notes/How%20we%20self%20sabotage.md)
- [How to Trust Your Inner Voice](Notes/How%20to%20Trust%20Your%20Inner%20Voice.md)

Go one level up: [Library](Maps/Library.md)

The space below is for my own use:

### Notes to Process
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[]]
and !outgoing([[]])
sort file.mtime desc
```
