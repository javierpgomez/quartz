Many of these areas (like managing taxes) work well in basic computer folders, PDFs, and spreadsheets. You can link from here to there. Then these notes become your hubs and launchpads. 

It's fine to leave some documents or projects within apps that are better-suited to handle them. But *notes* about these documents or projects can help you further reflect, ideate, or push goals forward. 

You might even find an excellent balance between managing projects and efforts outside of your core PKM tool, while spending time examining them in this space for a more mindful perspective.
