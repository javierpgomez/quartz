## Why "Efforts" are liberating
Thinking of your efforts as "efforts"—and not projects—is liberating and empowering because:

- **The definition is clear** 
    - Efforts require some sort of *effort*. When you tag a note as an effort, you are letting yourself know that some sort of effort is intended.
- **The definition is not too clear**
    - Efforts have _linguistic wiggle room_. Terms like "projects" are too narrow in scope to define the breadth of what an effort can be. This ambiguity is a feature, not a bug.
