# Concepts MOC
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas. 

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [OODA loop](Notes/OODA%20loop.md), [Levels of Magnification](Notes/Levels%20of%20Magnification.md), and [Refraction Thinking](Notes/Refraction%20Thinking.md).

As an entrepreneur, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [Reps](Notes/Reps.md), creating the conditions for [Flow](Notes/Flow.md), which involves environmental  [Forcing Functions](Notes/Forcing%20Function.md), and considering when I can multitask [Shadow Clone](Notes/Shadow%20Clone.md). 

[Natural Selection](Natural%20Selection.md) is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [Lindy Effect](Notes/Lindy%20Effect.md), along with [Hormesis](Notes/Hormesis.md) and [Antifragility](Notes/Antifragility.md)—and also more broadly [Cause and Effect](Notes/Cause%20and%20Effect.md). This reminds me of [Concept Expansion](Notes/Concept%20Expansion.md).

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [Yin and Yang](Notes/Yin%20and%20Yang.md), [Synthesis](Notes/Synthesis.md), [Seasons](Notes/Seasons.md), and the [Mountain Top Water Drop](Notes/Mountain%20Top%20Water%20Drop.md). Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [No-Face](Notes/No-Face.md) from Spirited Away, which leads to [The Id](Notes/The%20Id.md). [Aikido](Notes/Aikido.md) is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [Rubik's Cube](Notes/Rubik's%20Cube.md), or pull from [Munger's Mental Models](Munger's%20Mental%20Models.md).
