# Library
Navigate your library of maps with a classification system made specifically for PKM. 

The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

- 000 - *Knowledge Management*
- 100  - *Personal Management*
- 200 - *Philosophy & Psychology; Spirituality & Religion*
- 300 - *Social Sciences*
- 400 - *Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics*
- 500 - *Natural Sciences*
- 600 - *Applied Sciences*
- 700 - *Art & Recreation*
- 800 - *Literature*
- 900 - *History & Biography & Geography*

It is ready-made to hold your diverse interests. Add some placeholders below.

## 000 - Knowledge Management
The [Meta PKM](Maps/Meta%20PKM.md) shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [LYT Kit](Notes/LYT%20Kit.md) to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [Mapping MOCs](Maps/Mapping%20MOCs.md) is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:

- [Notebox](Maps/Notebox.md) | [LOL](LOL) |  [I want to...](I%20want%20to...)
- [Cartographer's Corner ðŸ—º](Cartographer's%20Corner%20%F0%9F%97%BA) | [Commonplace Book](Commonplace%20Book.md) |  [Knowledge and memory MOC](Knowledge%20and%20memory%20MOC)

## 100 - Personal Management
The [Thinking MOC](Maps/Thinking%20MOC.md) can galvanize my attention; the [Concepts MOC](Maps/Concepts%20MOC.md) can flavor it; and the [Habits MOC](Maps/Habits%20MOC.md) speaks about how to direct it. Hidden within in the [Cabin](Cabin.md). Go to my [Life Map](Maps/Life%20Map.md) to brush up on [My Virtues](Notes/My%20Virtues.md) and more.

- [Posture MOC](Posture%20MOC) | [Hormesis MOC](Maps/Hormesis%20MOC.md) | [Breathing Exercises MOC](Breathing%20Exercises%20MOC) | Flowcreation MOC
- People MOC | Family MOC | [Prominent People (kit)](Prominent%20People%20(kit))
- Efforts MOC | [Life Command âŒ˜](Notes/Life%20Command%20âŒ˜.md) | Plans and Reviews
- Finances MOC | Health MOC


## 200 - Philosophy, Psychology ; Spirituality, Religion
Is there no limit to this section? I use [Philosophy MOC (kit)](Maps/Philosophy%20MOC%20(kit).md) as the big note and then point to things like: [Stoicism MOC](Maps/Stoicism%20MOC.md), [Confucianism MOC](Confucianism%20MOC), [Religion MOC](Religion%20MOC), [Taoism MOC](Taoism%20MOC), and whatever else comes up.

[Psychology MOC (kit)](Psychology%20MOC%20(kit).md) is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 - Social Sciences ðŸ‘¥
*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*
While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. The best place to start is the [People MOC](Maps/People%20MOC.md). along with.

[Coaching MOC](Maps/Coaching%20MOC.md)
[Web3 MOC](Maps/Web3%20MOC.md)
[Culture MOC](Maps/Culture%20MOC.md)
[Geopolitics MOC](Notes/Geopolitics%20MOC.md)
[Cartography MOC](Maps/Cartography%20MOC.md)

## 400 - Communications, Language, & Linguistics
A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [Rhetoric MOC](Rhetoric%20MOC). And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [Language MOC](Maps/Language%20MOC.md), [Words MOC](Words%20MOC), and especially [Figures MOC](Figures%20MOC). Not too far behind is the [Leadership MOC](Leadership%20MOC).

## 500 - Natural Sciences
A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explore the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [Cosmology MOC](Cosmology%20MOC) and [Math MOC](Math%20MOC). 

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals | [Systems MOC (kit)](Maps/Systems%20MOC%20(kit).md)

## 600 - Applied Sciences
A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them. My undergrad was in [Engineering MOC](Engineering%20MOC), which relates to my interest in [Building Homes MOC](Building%20Homes%20MOC). Later on, I developed the [Editing Manual MOC](Editing%20Manual%20MOC).

## 700 - Art & Recreation
Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon. 

- Art MOC | [Design MOC](Design%20MOC) | Architecture | Painting | 
- Film & TV | [Movies MOC](Movies%20MOC) 
- Sports | [Football MOC](Football%20MOC) 
- Music | [Jazz MOC](Jazz%20MOC) | [Vocals MOC](Vocals%20MOC) 
- [Cooking MOC](Cooking%20MOC) | Leisure 

## 800 - Literature
If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania...we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [Literature MOC](Literature%20MOC) as a launchpad.

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography
I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [Ancient Greece MOC](Ancient%20Greece%20MOC), but I haven't cared to build out the [History MOC](History%20MOC) just yet. The [Places MOC](Maps/Places%20MOC.md) is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.

The [Art & Science Storytelling MOC](Art%20&%20Science%20Storytelling%20MOC) look at some great storytellers of history.

Please don't go crazy numbering things. We are just using a pre-made map so we can easily add dots of new interests.

### Some MOCs with no sorting yet
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [Library](Library.md)
and !outgoing([Library](Library.md))
sort file.mtime desc
```
