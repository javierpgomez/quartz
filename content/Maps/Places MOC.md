# Places MOC
Welcome to the Places MOC. It is the most under-developed major category for me, but I value having a "map" for "places", it's rather apt.

### Main Travel Categories
[Countries I've Been To](Countries%20I've%20Been%20To)
[Travel Purgatory List](Travel%20Purgatory%20List)

### Some Notable Places
[Journal of My Travels to XYZ](Journal%20of%20My%20Travels%20to%20XYZ)
[Mind Palace XYZ](Mind%20Palace%20XYZ)
