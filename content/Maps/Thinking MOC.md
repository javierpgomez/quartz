I always want to improve my thinking- but how can I do that well?

My goals are 
1. To improve the clarity of my thought
2. To make connections across disciplines
3. To find ways to address blind spots and biases

## To improve clarity of my thought

Part of my motivation behind this whole page is that [Note-making sharpens your thinking](Notes/Note-making%20sharpens%20your%20thinking.md). So this Javi-pedia is an exercise in making my ideas sharper, cleaner, and adding some accountability to it! (Send in your corrections please)

## To make connections across disciplines

It's fashionable now to come up with mental models that you can apply across different areas. Take for example [Refraction Thinking](Notes/Refraction%20Thinking.md) which is all about using one idea as a lens for another. 

In my case, I take a lot of principles from my health: For example [Using Fitness to Build up Your confidence](Notes/Using%20Fitness%20to%20Build%20up%20Your%20confidence.md)

## To find way to address blind spots and biases

Perhaps the hardest thing to do is make sure that I cover my weaknesses. So I'm always attracted to ideas that are counter-cultural, or at least unpopular today.

So anti-data (or anti-scientific) ideas like "[Traditions usually exist for a reason](Notes/Traditions%20usually%20exist%20for%20a%20reason.md)" and "[Data has killed our intuition](Notes/Data%20has%20killed%20our%20intuition.md)" I think are really cool.

Also in this day and age of self-reflection everything, being aware of the [The Introspection Trap](Notes/The%20Introspection%20Trap.md) has helped me move forward and bias to action.

### Notes to Process
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[]]
and !outgoing([[]])
sort file.mtime desc
