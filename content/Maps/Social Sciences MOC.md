A big puzzle that I think about often today is how to facilitate [Building Trust Online](Notes/Building%20Trust%20Online.md). In this day, it feels like it's extra challenging because we lose a lot of the non-verbal, energy level that comes from face to face communication.

Playing games like [Cooperation Simulated](Notes/Cooperation%20Simulated.md) can help get these ideas into our minds and bodies more.

Go one level up: [Library](Maps/Library.md)

### Notes to Process
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
```dataview
table file.mtime.year + "-" + file.mtime.month + "-" + file.mtime.day as Modified
from [[]]
and !outgoing([[]])
sort file.mtime desc
```
